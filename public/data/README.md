# Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by _Our World in Data_

Our complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by [_Our World in Data_](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinations as well as other variables of potential interest.

### üóÇÔ∏è Download our complete COVID-19 dataset : [CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) | [XLSX](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.xlsx) | [JSON](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json)

We will continue to publish up-to-date data on confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinations, throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.


## The data you find here and our data sources

- **Confirmed cases and deaths:** our data comes from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) (JHU). We discuss how and when JHU collects and publishes this data [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). The cases & deaths dataset is updated daily. *Note: the number of cases or deaths reported by any institution‚Äîincluding JHU, the WHO, the ECDC and others‚Äîon a given day does not necessarily represent the actual number on that date. This is because of the long reporting chain that exists between a new case/death and its inclusion in statistics. **This also means that negative values in cases and deaths can sometimes appear when a country corrects historical data, because it had previously overestimated the number of cases/deaths. Alternatively, large changes can sometimes (although rarely) be made to a country's entire time series if JHU decides (and has access to the necessary data) to correct values retrospectively.***
- **Hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions:** our data comes from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-data-hospital-and-icu-admission-rates-and-current-occupancy-covid-19) (ECDC) for a select number of European countries; the [government of the United Kingdom](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare); the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) for the United States; the [COVID-19 Tracker](https://covid19tracker.ca/) for Canada. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide data on hospitalizations for other countries: there is currently no global, aggregated database on COVID-19 hospitalization, and our team at _Our World in Data_ does not have the capacity to build such a dataset.
- **Testing for COVID-19:** this data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports; you can find further details in our post on COVID-19 testing, including our [checklist of questions to understand testing data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data), information on [geographical and temporal coverage](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#which-countries-do-we-have-testing-data-for), and [detailed country-by-country source information](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data). The testing dataset is updated around twice a week.
- **Vaccinations against COVID-19:** this data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports.
- **Other variables:** this data is collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, Global Burden of Disease, Blavatnik School of Government, etc.). More information is available in [our codebook](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv).


## The complete _Our World in Data_ COVID-19 dataset

**Our complete COVID-19 dataset is available in [CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv), [XLSX](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.xlsx), and [JSON](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json) formats, and includes all of our historical data on the pandemic up to the date of publication.**

The CSV and XLSX files follow a format of 1 row per location and date. The JSON version is split by country ISO code, with static variables and an array of daily records.

## Changelog

- Up until 17 March 2020, we were using WHO data manually extracted from their daily [situation report PDFs](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).
- From 19 March 2020, we started relying on data published by the [European CDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide). We wrote about [why we decided to switch sources](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sources-comparison).
- On 3 April 2020, we added country-level time series on COVID-19 tests.
- On 16 April 2020, we made available a [complete dataset of all of our main variables](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) related to confirmed cases, deaths, and tests.
- On 25 April 2020, we added rows for "World" and "International" to our complete dataset. The `iso_code` column for "International" is blank, and for "World" we use `OWID_WRL`.
- On 9 May 2020, we added new variables related to demographic, economic, and public health data to our complete dataset.
- On 19 May 2020, we added 2 variables related to testing: `new_tests_smoothed` and `new_tests_smoothed_per_thousand`. To generate them we assume that testing changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported (as not all countries report testing data on a daily basis). This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window.
- On 23 May 2020, we added a JSON version of our complete dataset.
- On 4 June 2020, we added a `continent` column to our complete dataset.
- On 1 July 2020, we changed the format of the JSON version of our complete dataset to normalize the data and reduce file size.
- On 4 August 2020, we added the `positive_rate` and `tests_per_case` columns to our complete dataset.
- On 7 August 2020, we transformed our markdown codebook to a CSV file to allow easier merging with the complete dataset.
- On 17 August 2020, we added 4 variables related to cases and deaths: `new_cases_smoothed`, `new_deaths_smoothed`, `new_cases_smoothed_per_million`, and `new_deaths_smoothed_per_million`. These metrics are averaged versions (over a rolling 7-day window) of the daily variables.
- On 10 September 2020, we added the `human_development_index` column to our complete dataset.
- On 14 October 2020, we added data on excess mortality during the pandemic in the `excess_mortality` folder, sourced from [the Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/) and [the UK Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020).
- On 29 October 2020, we added data on hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, sourced from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-data-hospital-and-icu-admission-rates-and-current-occupancy-covid-19) (ECDC), who provide these statistics only for a select number of European countries, and update it on a weekly basis.
- On 10 November 2020, we added data on hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for the United States, sourced from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).
- On 13 November 2020, we added real-time estimates of the effective reproduction rate (R) of the virus, sourced from [Arroyo Marioli et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3581633).
- On 30 November 2020, we changed our source for confirmed cases and deaths to the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Our previous source for confirmed cases and deaths, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), [had announced in November 2020](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) that it would switch from a daily to a weekly reporting schedule from December. _Our World in Data_ therefore had to transition away from the ECDC as a source to continue to provide daily updates of confirmed cases and deaths. The data last sourced from the ECDC remains available as an archive in the [`ecdc`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/ecdc) folder. The format (variable names and types) of our complete COVID-19 dataset remains the same.
- On 9 December 2020, we changed the names of three countries in our files to match their recently-changed official names. `Czech Republic` has become `Czechia`, `Macedonia` has become `North Macedonia`, and `Swaziland` has become `Eswatini`.
- On 16 December 2020, we started collecting country-level time series on COVID-19 vaccinations.
- On 18 December 2020, we added in the [`latest`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/latest) folder a shortened version of our complete dataset with only the latest value for each location and metric (within a limit of 2 weeks in the past). This file is available in CSV, XLSX, and JSON formats.
- On 19 December 2020, we added data on hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for Canada, sourced from the [COVID-19 Tracker](https://covid19tracker.ca/).
- On 6 January 2021, we added two variables for daily vaccinations to our complete dataset.
- On 7 January 2021, we replaced the United Kingdom's hospital and ICU data previously gathered by the European CDC with [the official data published by the British government](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare).
- On 26 January 2021, we added 4 variables on people vaccinated & people fully vaccinated to our complete dataset.
- On 4 February 2021, we added rows for Africa, Asia, Europe, European Union, North America, Oceania, and South America to our complete dataset. The `iso_code` column for these rows starts with `OWID_`.


## Data alterations

- The population estimates we use to calculate per-capita metrics are all based on the last revision of the [United Nations World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/). The exact values can be viewed [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/scripts/input/un/population_2020.csv).
- We standardize names of countries and regions. Since the names of countries and regions are different in different data sources, we standardize all names to the [_Our World in Data_ standard entity names](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/jhu/locations.csv).
- We may correct or discard inconsistencies that we detect in the original data.
- Testing data is collected from many different sources. A detailed documentation for each country is available in [our post on COVID-19 testing](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country).
- Where we collect multiple time series for a given country in our testing data (for example: for the United States, we collect data from both the CDC, and the COVID Tracking Project), our complete COVID-19 dataset only includes the most complete, or, if equally complete, data on the number of people tested rather than the number of tests/samples/swabs processed. The list of 'secondary' test series (those removed) is located in [`scripts/input/owid/secondary_testing_series.csv`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/scripts/input/owid/secondary_testing_series.csv).
