In some early reports, the testing figures' units are unclear because the same testing figures refer to both the number of cases tested and the number of tests performed; later reports are standardised and testing figures consistently refer to the number of tests performed, so we assume that the discrepancy is due to ambiguous language and translation issues.

Testing figures refer to PCR and antigen tests. Antigen tests were first reported in Albania on [8 December 2020](https://shendetesia.gov.al/covid19-ministria-e-shendetesise-2532-testime-347-te-sheruar-753-raste-te-reja-dhe-14-humbje-jete-ne-24-oret-e-fundit/). Serological tests are also performed in Albania for ""screening purposes"" (""për arsye depistimi""), meaning that positive results are not used to confirm cases of COVID-19, and so they are excluded from our testing figures to ensure the accuracy of our Positive Rate. In reports from 10 Nov to 6 Dec 2020, testing figures refer to the total number of tests, and specifcy the number of which that are 'for screening purposes'; in such instances, we report the difference between these two figures in order to exclude serological tests. As such, our cumulative total differs that from the total tests ('Testime totale') reported by the source."

We calculate a positive rate for Argentina by dividing the 7-day sum of positive tests (column ""positivos"") by the 7-day sum of tests performed (column ""total"").

It is unclear whether the reported figures include pending test results.

We do not include the last 5 days of data, as the lags in reporting would lead to an underestimated number of tests, and therefore an overestimated positive rate.

More similar additions were made later in January.

Starting in January 2021, the Austrian government is reporting testing data with a counting methodology that is no longer comparable to the case definition that it uses to report confirmed cases.

— The number of cases reported for Belgium only includes cases confirmed by a positive PCR test.
— The number of tests reported by Sciensano in its time series of tests performed includes both PCR and antigen tests.

As such, we conclude that a positive result from a PCR test is necessary to diagnose cases of COVID-19 and that testing figures refer to PCR tests.

Recent daily briefs consistently report testing figures in terms of the cumulative number of tests (""pruebas"") performed. However, in the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily briefs previously reported testing figures using inconsistent terminology such as samples (“muestras”) tested, people who have undergone tests (”personas, que fueron sometidas a pruebas”), and tests (""pruebas"") performed. It does not appear that this inconsistent use of terminology reflects a substantive change in the reported figures, since there are no corresponding large breaks in the time series.

In 10 briefs, the number of negative tests was not reported, preventing us from calculating a total for that date. For these dates with missing official data, we use data provided in this [unofficial GitHub repository](https://github.com/mauforonda/covid19-bolivia), which we have cross-referenced against the official data for all dates.

Brazil includes positive antibody tests in their figures for confirmed cases.

We calculate the Positive Rate as the 7-day average of positive tests divided by the 7-day average of tests performed. 

To calculate the total number of PCR tests performed, we sum the ""positivas_acumuladas"" and ""negativas_acumuladas"" columns, thus excluding indeterminate and pending tests; it is unclear if the reported number of antigen tests performed includes indeterminate and pending tests.

Additional data is available from the ""Datos generales de casos COVID-19"" [CSV](https://geovision.uned.ac.cr/oges/archivos_covid/2021_02_04/02_04_21_CSV_GENERAL.csv) on [this webpage](https://geovision.uned.ac.cr/oges/), which we use to construct a time series of people tested. Data is available from 6 March 2020.

Prior to 24 July 2020, suspected COVID-19 cases in Costa Rica could only be confirmed via a positive PCR test result, as described in the 12 June 2020 national [guidelines](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_12062020_v14_vf.pdf) for COVID-19 surveillance. However, revised [guidelines](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_v15_24072020.pdf) published on 24 July 2020 expand the definition of a confirmed COVID-19 case to allow for cases to be confirmed without a PCR test, by epidemiological link.

In the dataset, ""nue_posi"" refers to ""daily positive cases"" (""Nuevos casos diarios positivos por COVID-19""), ""conf_nexo"" refers to ""daily positive cases confirmed by epidemiological link"" (""Nuevos casos diarios positivos por COVID-19 confirmados por nexo epidemiológico""), and ""nue_descar"" refers to ""daily cases whose laboratory tests were negative"" (""Nuevos casos diarios cuyos exámenes de laboratorio dieron negativo""). We subtract ""conf_nexo"" from ""nue_posi"" to determine the number of daily cases confirmed by a positive laboratory test. We then add this value to ""nue_descar"" to determine the total number of daily people tested by PCR test. We also estimate the Positive Rate by dividing the 7-day average of daily cases confirmed by a positive PCR test by the 7-day average of daily people tested by PCR test.

On 29 Jan 2021, ""the Ministry of Health endorsed the acquisition and use of antigen tests"" in 10 laboratories, according to [this article](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/index.php/centro-de-prensa/noticias/746-noticias-2021/2042-laboratorios-con-aval-de-salud-para-realizar-pruebas-de-antigeno-de-sars-cov-2?fbclid=IwAR3c0c_YI28AnSjIsCdP1kOczUcE_cVYghZ9c7SjRFauCSQ540eIjkddzPE). We will monitor the situation to determine if these antigen tests are included in testing and case figures.

It is unclear from the source whether or not the cumulative figure repeatedly counts people that have gone through more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. Since we derive a count of the daily number of people tested from the change in this cumulative number, if people undergoing multiple rounds of testing are not counted repeatedly in the cumulative, repeat testers will not appear in our daily testing figures."

The updates use the words ""samples taken"" to describe these figures, which likely indicates that they include tests whose results are still pending.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source)."

It is unclear whether the reported figures include tests for which the results are pending.

Prior to 24 March 2020, testing figures were reported in terms of ""samples tested"" (e.g. ""Ukupno je 317 testiranih uzoraka...""). From 24 March to 6 May 2020, testing figures were reported in terms of ""tests performed"" (e.g. ""Dosad je obavljeno ukupno 3.159 testiranja""). Since 6 May 2020 they have been reported in terms of ""people tested"" (e.g. ""Dosad je testirano ukupno 41.053 osoba""). It does not appear that this change in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, however, since there were no large breaks in the time series coinciding with these changes in terminology.

On 1 November 2020, the Minister of Health announced in a [press release](https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/beros-od-utorka-brzi-antigenski-testovi-uskoro-novo-serolosko-testiranje/30740) that antigen and antibody tests will be used ""to determine how many people in Croatia were in contact with the virus"". However, it is unclear if antigen and antibody tests will be included in testing figures, or if positive results from these tests will be included in confirmed case figures.

The source provides data for both the cumulative number of people tested to date and the number of people tested in the last 24 hours. The daily change in the cumulative number of people tested to date equals the number of people tested in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the cumulative total will repeatedly count people that have undergone more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. However no further details were found at either source.

We have found testing data dating back to 3 March 2020, at which point 247 samples had been tested to date.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source)."

It includes a time series for the number of tests.

Antigen tests cannot be used to confirm cases of COVID-19, according to an [article](http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2021-01-26/antigen-testing-of-suspected-covid-19-patients-in-havana) published by the Communist Party of Cuba Central Committee: ""patients whose antigen test is negative are referred to hospitals specialized in treating non-COVID related respiratory illnesses, while those testing positive are transferred to isolation centers for suspected cases, where they will be given a PCR test, to definitively confirm whether or not they have been infected with the SARS-COV-2 virus""'. Testing figures refer to the number of PCR tests, according to our [source](https://covid19cubadata.github.io/#cuba). This is corroborated by the fact that the number of cases is equal to the number of positive test results reported by the [Ministry of Health](https://salud.msp.gob.cu/category/covid-19/).

The context in which the figures are published suggests that the number of tests performed may be equivalent to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results is given, along with a positive test rate. It is also unclear whether the reported figures include tests for which the results are pending.

The source of data is the Central Information System of Infectious Diseases (ISIN). The primary data were analytically processed and subsequently transformed into a form that can be published online by the IHIS CR team.""

We calculate the daily number of tests performed based on the sum of ""pocet_PCR_testy"" (PCR tests) and ""pocet_AG_testy"" (antigen tests).

We also calculate a positive rate by dividing the 7-day sum of positive results (""incidence_pozitivni"") by the 7-day sum of tests performed. This positive rate is calculated based on PCR and antigen tests (rather than only PCR) because our source for confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) includes the positive results of antigen tests in the count of daily confirmed cases in Czechia. The results of our positive rate will therefore be different from the graph shown on the [official dashboard](https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19) since the latter is based on PCR tests alone.

- ""The actual number of infections in Finland is probably higher than reported, as not all mild symptoms have been tested so far and no information is available on the number of asymptomatic infections.""
- ""Coronavirus testing is performed in both the public and private sectors in several laboratories.""

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age."""

It systematically records the laboratory results of tests performed by all city laboratories and hospitals concerning SARS-COV2.

Since December 8, after having verified the quality of the data reported, the national public health agency [announced](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/presse/2020/covid-19-sante-publique-france-adapte-ses-indicateurs-pour-surveiller-au-plus-pres-l-epidemie) that all PCR and antigen test results would now be included in the calculation of national epidemiological indicators.
An adjustment of the duplicate testing methods for patients benefiting from repeated testing during the pandemic (and therefore of the definition of ""tested persons"") has also been made. These changes have no impact on the trends and interpretation of the dynamics of the epidemic, which remain the same.
Previously, negative multi-testers were excluded, with the result that the number of people tested was increasingly underestimated over time. The positive rates were very close regardless of the method of calculation used until the week of August 9, when a gap began to appear, due to the very large number of tests performed and the exclusion of the multi-tested negative persons.

This data does not allow us to publish any cumulative total, since no information is available on how many people had been tested prior to the first day of reporting.

The positive rate we use is collected directly from the [COVID-19 epidemic monitoring indicators](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/indicateurs-de-suivi-de-lepidemie-de-covid-19/) dataset published on the same platform by the Ministry of Solidarity and Health."

Where people are tested multiple times, each test will be counted individually. There appear to be reporting lags in the weekly figures, such that the reported figures for any given week increase over the following weeks as labs report additional results. Pending tests are included in the testing figures. The testing figures of up to 204 labs within the country are reported in the dataset. Data is available from the week ending 8 March 2020.

Our positive rate reflects the official positive rate recorded in column ""Positivenquote (%)"" of the spreadsheet.

On 22 October 2020, the Robert Koch Institute published an update of the [National Test Strategy](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/Ausgaben/43_20.pdf?__blob=publicationFile). This update states on page 4 that ‘antigen tests can, under certain conditions, be a useful addition to the PCR test. Antigen tests thus contribute to the further expansion of test capacity’. A [daily status report](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Dez_2020/2020-12-02-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) from 2 December 2020 notes, 'this can have the consequence that the population of the tested persons differs from that of the previous weeks’, as antigen tests are used instead of PCR tests in certain scenarios, which may cause the positive rate to increase. ‘Therefore the positive rates of the previous weeks are not directly comparable with the positive rates from Week 46’. According to [this infographic](https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/Bilder/InfAZ/neuartiges_Coronavirus/Teststrategie.png?__blob=poster&v=8) from 23 November 2020, positive results from antigen tests must be confirmed with a PCR test, and so they are not included in reported case figures. Antigen tests are also not included in reported testing figures, according to weekly status reports such as on [25 Nov 2020](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Nov_2020/2020-11-25-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile).

Data is available from 17 March 2020.

Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures differ from one another by exactly 981 tests on each day, which is due to persons under mandatory quarantine undergoing multiple test (2,022 samples tested on 1,041 persons). This discrepancy of 981 tests is small, representing less than 1% of cumulative samples tested at the time. In contrast, the cumulative number of samples tested through routine surveillance and contact tracing are exactly equal to the cumulative number of persons tested on each day in these respective categories. 

Prior to 10 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide testing figures using inconsistent terminology, varying between ""samples tested"", ""persons tested"", ""suspected cases tested"", and similar language. Nevertheless, we choose to include all of these figures within our constructed time series, since the variation in terminology does not appear to correspond to large breaks in the time series. In addition, based on the fact that the number of samples tested differs only slightly from the number of persons tested over the 10 May to 26 May 2020 period, we have no reason to believe that the variation in terminology prior to 10 May has any serious ramifications for the interpretation of the time series as the cumulative number of samples tested. From 10 May 2020 onwards, the daily situation updates consistently report the cumulative number of samples tested. 

No further information is provided about the reported testing numbers, such as whether they include pending or non-PCR tests."

Since [26 September 2020](https://eody.gov.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/covid-gr-daily-report-26-09-2020.pdf), the number of antigen tests performed to date are also reported in the press releases, separately from the number of PCR tests. We combine these two figures to determine the total number of samples tested, because our [source](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/greece) for the number of confirmed cases includes positive results from both PCR and antigen tests.

The press releases from ICMR do not always stay online for very long. The reason for this is unknown, but the releases are being backed up at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datameet/covid19).

On some occasions there appear to have been more than one update released per day. Where we are aware of multiple observations for the day, we show the number for the earlier release.

The ICMR website does not explicitly state whether the reported figures refer to PCR tests only. From contextual information, it appears that the reported figures may also include samples that were tested using a TrueNat non-PCR test. ICMR communications on [21 May 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/press_realease_files/ICMR_Press_Release_TruNat_21052020.pdf) and [19 April 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/labs/Additional_guidance_on_TrueNat_based_COVID19_testing.pdf) indicate that TrueNat tests are being used in diagnostic testing.

However, testing figures provided by the [National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure (BNPB)](https://www.bnpb.go.id/) via [twitter](https://twitter.com/bnpb_indonesia?lang=en) explicitly report the number of PCR tests conducted to date, which match the cumulative testing figures provided in the Ministry of Health dashboard. The PCR testing figures reported by the BNPB include a small number of ""rapid molecular tests"" (""Test Cepat Molekular""), which are diagnostic tests not to be confused with serological (antibody) tests.

A [conversation on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/issues/864) of the Department of Civil Protection leads us to strongly suspect that people undergoing multiple rounds of testing over the course of the pandemic are not repeatedly counted in these figures. For this reason, since 23 October 2020 we use the ""tests performed"" series as our series of reference for Italy's testing data.

This figure is available for each individual region separately at the source indicated. However it appears that data is missing for individual regions for particular dates – we assume that these are also missing from the aggregate total for Italy that we provide. The list of missing data, in English, can be seen at the bottom of [this data dashboard built by Franco Mossotto](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/91350339-2c97-49b5-92b8-965996530f00/page/RdlHB). 

It is clear that there are delays in timeline running up to a test being reported – both in terms of the time it takes for a symptomatic person to receive a test, and in the time for that test to then get reported in the data. For one region, Lombardy, [an investigation](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.09320.pdf) found the latter delay in the early period of the outbreak to be around 3-4 days.

There is significant variation in testing practices – in terms of how many tests are conducted and how they are allocated across the population – across regions and these practices have also changed over time. The extent to which tests pending results are included appears to vary across regions.

The tweets and press releases usually report testing figures in terms of the number of ""samples tested"". However, the wording used in some tweets and press releases makes it unclear whether the figures relate to the number of samples tested or the number of people tested. For example, the relevant tweet on [4 June 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1268563481235787776) says ""2,640 samples tested in the last 24 hours"", while the relevant tweet on [1 August 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1289552051916009475) states that ""727 people are the latest to test positive for Covid-19 from a sample of 6,371 tested in the last 24 hrs"". It does not appear that this inconsistency in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, since there are no large breaks in the time series that correspond to the use of ""samples tested"" versus ""people tested"" terminology. Instead, the wording of the tweets and press releases suggests that the reported number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested.

It is unclear whether the reported figures include tests for which the results are pending.

We are unsure of the reasons for this discrepancy.

The earliest reported figure in the official NCDC dashboard was from 4 March 2020 (3 samples tested). It is unclear how many samples were tested before this date. Because of this lack of historical data, we do not include any cumulative total for the testing data for Libya."

The daily total is available from [28 Sept 2020](https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1310630037381668866/photo/1) until 23 Nov 2020; we determined the cumulative total by summing the daily totals. Both the cumulative and daily totals are available since [24 Nov 2020](https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1320050775872200706); we still determine the cumulative total by summing the daily totals. Note that the sum of daily totals is less that the reported cumulative total, with an average deficit of around 5,500, or about 1%; the cause of this discrepancy is unclear, but appears to be innocuous.

Prior to 26 June 2020, our source was the daily update videos posted to the Maldives Ministry of Health [official Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthMV), which reported the number of positive, pending, and total “Laboratory Sample[s]” tested toward the end of these videos they report ; before 16 June 2020 the number of negative samples was also reported. The positive, negative, and total numbers are cumulative, while the pending numbers are current as of that day.

From 16–25 June 2020, we used the reported total, which likely includes pending tests. Before 16 June 2020, when negative numbers were reported, we used the total of positive and negative numbers rather than the reported total, since the latter generally included pending values and occasionally contained discrepant numbers that did not match any combination of the positive, negative, or pending numbers. Data is available from [16 March 2020](https://www.facebook.com/561317043971945/videos/2617005481743781/), when 221 samples had been tested.

According to the [case definition](https://covid19.health.gov.mv/updated-case-definitions-for-covid-19/) published 9 Jan 2021, a positive PCR test is necessary to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antigen tests are available but not recommended, and all results should be reported to HPA. It is therefore unclear if antigen tests are included in the number of samples tested; the case definition must match the test definition in order for the Positive Rate to be accurate, and so we exclude our estimate from the dataset."

According to a [post](https://fr.ami.mr/Depeche-56446.html) by the Ministry of Information, antigen tests cannot be used to confirm cases of COVID-19, but are used for screening purposes. Since 7 July 2020, the daily situation reports have differentiated between the number of tests performed in the past 24 hours and the number of ""diagnostic"" tests performed in the past 24 hours. For example, the [11 October 2020 situation report](http://www.sante.gov.mr/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/111020-Mauritanie-Sitrep-COVID-19_FR-.pdf) states: ""91 tests performed today including 83 diagnostic tests"" (translated). The non-diagnostic tests presumably refer to antigen and antibody screening tests. However, it is unclear if these screening tests are included in the cumulative number of tests performed to date. The case definition therefore may not match the test definition, and so we remove our estimate of the Positive Rate."

The files can be downloaded in CSV format.

To arrive at the time series shown on our website, we use the CSV files for confirmed cases (""confirmados"") and negative cases (""negativos""). For each file, we only keep the row that reports national data, merge the two files together, and add up confirmed and negative cases to find the number of people tested each day. We then calculate the positive rate as the 7-day sum of positive tests divided by the 7-day sum of people tested.

On November 22nd, the Ministry of Health announced in a [press conference](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/articulos/version-estenografica-conferencia-de-prensa-informe-diario-sobre-coronavirus-covid-19-en-mexico-257772?idiom=es) that antigen tests can now be used to confirm cases of COVID-19. They also established that antigen tests are now included in testing figures. A [press release](https://www.gob.mx/salud/prensa/188-prueba-diagnostica-de-pcr-garantiza-un-resultado-confiable-de-covid-19?idiom=es) on Nov 5th confirmed that antibody tests are neither used for case confirmation nor included in testing and case figures.

Two pieces of evidence suggest that people undergoing multiple rounds of testing over the course of the pandemic may be counted each round: 1) Figures refer to the number of cases tested, and each case has a unique ID; and 2) The source provides the number of cases with samples tested in the past 24 hours, which matches the daily change in the cumulative number of cases tested.

Data starts on 1 January 2020; we do not know if this is because tests started on that date or because earlier data is not available."

We construct a time series of the cumulative total number of cases tested to date using updates from the Ministry of Health's official Twitter page ([@Ministere_Sante](https://twitter.com/Ministere_Sante)). There are usually two updates per day, of which we use the latter.

On 15 April 2020, the Ministry of Health published a [Protocol for the Management of Patients with COVID-19 and their Contacts](http://www.covidmaroc.ma/Documents/2020/coronavirus/PS/CIR-protocole%20pec%20patients%20et%20leurs%20contacts%20et%20mises%20%C3%A0%20jour%20des%20d%C3%A9finitions.pdf). This document states on page 2 that cases of COVID-19 can be confirmed by a positive result from either a PCR or antigen test. As such, both PCR and antigen tests are presumably included in the testing figures.

The source provides the daily number of cases confirmed and discarded. The mention of 'cases' suggests that people undergoing multiple rounds of testing over the course of the pandemic may be repeatedly counted. However, no further details are provided by the source.

From 2 March to 18 May 2020 we used data stored in [this unofficial GitHub repository](https://github.com/RedaElmar/COVID-19_Morocco) instead of the official source to automate data collection. We have cross-checked a sample of the figures reported in the unofficial source against official data reported by the Ministry of Health to ensure accuracy.

Antigen tests have been used to confirm cases of COVID-19 under specific conditions, according to a [report](https://www.misau.gov.mz/index.php/covid-19-directrizes?download=856:guiao-para-a-implementacao-de-testes-de-diagnostico-rapidos-de-antigeno-para-o-sars-cov-2-em-mocambique) published by the Ministry of Health. The report states that all antigen tests and positive results must be reported to the Ministry of Health.

The number of positive cases registered and the total number of negative tests is equal to the number of total tests conducted for the majority of the daily reports released. For dates where this is not the case, we favour the sum of positive cases registered and the number of negative tests. From 3 October 2020, the MOH no longer reports the number of negative tests. Instead, it reports the number of tests in the last 24 hours and the cumulative number of tests.

There are reports published prior to the 28 March (the earliest we could find is dated 18 March 2020) that include the number of positive and negative tests conducted by the National Institute of Health or in private laboratories. However, the cumulative totals for 26 and 27 March 2020 are inconsistent with the cumulative total reported for the 28 March 2020 onwards. Therefore, to avoid potential inconsistenies with the series from 28 March 2020, we do not include these testing figures."

We were alerted by a Technical Advisor within the Cabinet of the Secretary of Health to the fact that these figures only captures people who were reported through the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance which does not include many of the people that get tested but are never entered into the surveillance system (because they do not meet the criteria and go on to test negatively). For this reason we have now switched to the current series. The advisor confirmed to us that this series: includes all the public, private and university labs performing SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in Portugal; does not include tests pending results.

Since October 2020, rapid antigen tests are also being performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in Portugal. Since positive results from these antigen tests are notified and counted in daily national figures for confirmed cases, we include them in the number of tests performed in the country.

For all intents and purposes Slovenia's case definition is therefore defined only by positive PCR results, even if some people are getting screened and found via antigen before they are confirmed with PCR.

We do not include the daily test figures published in the daily 'Updates' due to persistent reporting lags. Furthermore, there appear to be reporting lags in the weekly reports, such that the figures for any given week increase the following week.

The testing figures refer to the number of tests performed. Where people are tested multiple times, each test will be counted individually. On page 5 of the [Strategy for Early Detection Surveillance and Control of COVID-19](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf), it states that ‘if the PDIA is negative and there is high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, a repeat test will be considered’, meaning that multiple tests may be required to confirm one diagnosis. As such, estimates of positive rates based on the number of tests and the number of confirmed cases may be greater than the true figure. It is unclear if pending results are included in the testing figures.

This update states on page 6 that positive results from both PCR and antigen tests can be used to confirm diagnoses for COVID-19. Furthermore, it states on page 6 that positive results from IgM antibody tests can also be used to confirm active cases of COVID-19, when the clinical criteria for suspected cases are also met; it also states on page 19 that under ‘exceptional’ circumstances, positive results from IgG antibody tests can be used to confirm resolved cases of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients, but that ‘screening through serological tests is not recommended’; as such, antibody tests are likely to represent only a small fraction of total tests.

It is unclear whether the reported figures include tests pending results.

In the daily snapshots, the wording used to report the cumulative testing figures does not make it clear as to whether the reported figures relate to the number of tests performed or the number of persons tested. For example, the cumulative testing figure reported on 6 August 2020 is ""1,116,641 tested"" (translated from ""протестовано""). The [english version](https://covid19.gov.ua/en) of the same page reports the same figure as ""total of tests"", which is also unclear. [A more detailed dashboard](https://covid19.gov.ua/analitichni-paneli-dashbordy) on the same web domain provides testing figures in downloadable csv files dating back to 1 June 2020, where each csv file contains separate columns for the cumulative number of PCR tests and non-PCR tests. The cumulative PCR testing figures reported in these csv files are described as ""The number of laboratory tests performed by PCR on COVID-19"" (""Кількість проведених лабораторних досліджень методом ПЛР на COVID-19""), making it clear that the figures refer to the number of tests performed (which may or may not be equivalent to the number of people tested).

The cumulative PCR testing figures provided in the csv files tend to be approximately 2% smaller than the testing figures provided in the daily snapshots. Nevertheless, we assume that this discrepancy is due to small differences in the reference date, reporting laboratories included, or other minor details, rather than the possibility that the daily snapshot figures include non-PCR tests or refer to a metric other than the number of tests performed. The cumulative number of non-PCR tests reported in the csv files are much larger than the size of this discrepancy.

The earliest reported figure that we have been able to find is from 9 April 2020, at which point 20,608 cumulative tests were reported.

It is also explained in the description that the data ""excludes serology tests where possible"", which may indicate that not 100% of the tests included in the time series are PCR tests.

We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that 856 samples had been tested as of 13 February 2020.

We have been unable to find testing figures in any of the bulletins published between 29 April 2020 and 28 July 2020, with the exception of a 4 July 2020 bulletin reporting that 379,701 samples had been tested to date. From 29 July 2020 onwards, the bulletins make it clear that the testing figures relate to PCR tests only.

Some bulletins report the cumulative number of people tested alongside the cumulative number of samples tested. Oddly, the cumulative number of people tested is larger than the cumulative number of samples tested. For example, [the 18 September 2020 bulletin](http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/phong-chong-dich-benh-viem-phoi-cap-ncov/14061/ban-tin-cap-nhat-dich-benh-covid-19-ngay-18-9-2020) reports 1,183,341 samples tested to date using PCR, while at the same time reporting 1,358,575 people tested to date. Further, a 15 March 2021 [press statement](https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/-/6847912-112) reports 2,482,302 RT-PCR tests as well as 3,248,873 people tested. The article also states that ""the number of rooms capable of testing for ... SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR technique is 157 rooms, the maximum testing capacity is about 62,593 samples / day"", while ""the number of rooms that have been allowed for confirmed testing is 101 rooms with a maximum testing capacity of about 50,663 samples per day."" In another [article](https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/-/6847912-109), it is stated that ""in case of suspected positive, positive must immediately transfer the sample to the laboratory that has been allowed to test confirm SARS-CoV-2"". As such, one explanation for this discrepancy is that samples are tested multiple times.

Bulletins published between 13 February 2020 and 28 April 2020 report the cumulative number of samples tested to date alongside the cumulative number of samples with positive test results and the cumulative number of samples with negative test results, which suggests that in this time period the total number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it is unclear whether samples with negative test results include instances of resampling for the same person."
ZMB,Zambia - tests performed,2021-04-29,https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19,Government of Zambia,,383,1394900,75.876,5500,0.299,4207,0.229,0.012,85.6,Zambia Ministry of Health,https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19,The number of tests performed.,"The Zambia Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Zambia Statistics Agency, provides a time series of the number of samples tested each day since 19 March 2020 in an [official dashboard](https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19).

The dashboard data is sourced from daily reports produced by the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.zm/) (published on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mohzambia) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mohzambia) pages) and the [Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)](https://znphi.co.zm/news/situation-reports-new-coronavirus-covid-19-sitreps). 

To ensure accuracy, we have cross-checked a sample of the dashboard figures against the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI reports.

Official reports from the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI use the terminology ""tests conducted"" and ""samples tested"" interchangeably over time, with no indication that the choice of terminology represents a substantive difference in the reported figures.

The reported figures that are based on ZNPHI reports exclude pending test results, while it is unclear whether the reported figures from the Ministry of Health reports exclude pending test results. Nevertheless, pending test results represent a small fraction of overall tests, so this possible discrepancy is of minor consequence."
ZWE,Zimbabwe - tests performed,2021-04-28,https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim/status/1387503885955256325,Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care,,355,488826,32.889,2025,0.136,1716,0.115,0.018,56.9,Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care,http://www.mohcc.gov.zw,The number of tests performed.,"The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care provides daily press releases on its website and Twitter account ([@MoHCCZim](https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim)) that report the cumulative number of tests performed to date. The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results.

The press release for 6 May 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 ""rapid screening"" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.

Prior to 6 May 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on 6 May 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests.

Since [19 Jan 2021](https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim/status/1351632194033360903/photo/1), the press releases report a combined cumualtive total of PCR and rapid antigen tests. According to a [United Nations report](https://zimbabwe.un.org/en/111012-capacitating-rural-health-facilities-rapid-covid-19-testing), published on 27 January 2021, antigen tests can be used to diagnose cases of COVID-19."
