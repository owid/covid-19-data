According to the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf), dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling). 

It is unclear whether the testing figures include technologies other than PCR tests. In a communication on 3 April 2020, Sciensano indicates that an antigen test made by Coris Bioconcept may now be used for COVID-19 detection. The communication states that positive antigen test results do not have to be confirmed by a PCR test, but that negative or doubtful cases must be confirmed by a PCR test.

Official figures reported in Sciensano's daily epidemiological bulletins do not help to clarify whether non-PCR tests are included in the daily time series figures. For example, as of 10 May 2020, the [official time series dataset](https://epistat.sciensano.be/covid/covid19_historicaldata.html) reported a cumulative total of 465,201 tests performed between 1 March and 9 May 2020. However, the epidemiological bulletin for [10 May 2020](https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_Daily%20report_20200510%20-%20FR.pdf) states that 325,796 cumulative tests had been performed by laboratories between the beginning of March and 9 May 2020, while an additional 240,305 tests had been performed through the national testing platform (566,101 total tests).

The bulletin indicates that these figures include both PCR and antigen tests, suggesting that the large discrepancy between the 465,201 figure and the combined 566,101 figure may be due to the fact that the official time series data only includes PCR tests, whereas the official bulletin figures include both PCR and antigen tests. However, we have been unable to find official documentation from Sciensano that resolves this ambiguity."

The briefs often (but do not always) provide a breakdown of the cumulative number of confirmed, suspected, and negative (also called discarded) tests to date. We measure the total number of tests performed to date as the sum of the number of confirmed and negative tests.

Because of the way the daily briefs report the number of negative tests (""pruebas negativas"") alongside the number of positive cases (""casos positivos""), it may be the case that the number of tests performed is equivalent to the number of people tested.

The reported number of tests performed may include non-PCR tests. [Official protocol for COVID-19 laboratory diagnosis](https://www.minsalud.gob.bo/component/jdownloads/download/30-guias-manejo-covid/445-protocolo-para-el-diagnostico-de-laboratorio-en-el-marco-de-la-emergencia-sanitaria-por-covid-actualizado?Itemid=646) (updated in May 2020) indicate that antibody (non-PCR) tests are an important aspect of the country's screening and diagnostic process (e.g. see pages 24-27 and annex 2). But the source does not explicitly state whether these non-PCR tests are used to confirm or discard suspected cases without a corresponding PCR test result.

As of 5 August 2020, the most recent daily briefs consistently report testing figures in terms of the cumulative number of tests (""pruebas"") performed. However, in the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily briefs previously reported testing figures using inconsistent terminology such as samples (“muestras”) tested, people who have undergone tests (”personas, que fueron sometidas a pruebas”), and tests (""pruebas"") performed. It does not appear that this inconsistent use of terminology reflects a substantive change in the reported figures, since there are no corresponding large breaks in the time series.

In 10 briefs the number of negative tests was not reported, preventing us from calculating a total for that date. For these dates with missing official data, we use data provided in this [unofficial GitHub repository](https://github.com/mauforonda/covid19-bolivia), which we have cross-referenced against the official data for all dates.

These updates state the daily number of people who have been tested – given as the number of confirmed cases (‘Confirma contagio’) and number of people with negative results (‘Descarta contagio’) (thus the figures do not include pending tests). We use these daily updates to construct a full time series of the cumulative number of persons tested to date. These figures have been collected and are made available for download by the news website [El Observador](https://observador.cr/covid19-estadisticas/), from which we take our data.

It is unclear from the source whether or not the cumulative figure repeatedly counts people that have gone through more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. Since we derive a count of the daily number of people tested from the change in this cumulative number, if people undergoing multiple rounds of testing are not counted repeatedly in the cumulative, repeat testers will not appear in our daily testing figures.

Daily testing figures are only available since 11 March 2020. We therefore do not know the first date of testing, or daily figures prior to this date.

For the number of new tests reported on 25 March 2020, we noticed a discrepancy between data published by El Observador and the official data reported by the Ministry of Health. We therefore replaced the number of discarded tests for that day (5) with the official number (65) (official reports: [24 March 2020](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/img_cvd/img_datos_marzo_2020_14.jpeg), [25 March 2020](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/img_cvd/img_datos_marzo_2020_15.jpeg)).

Prior to 24 July 2020, suspected COVID-19 cases in Costa Rica could only be confirmed via a positive PCR test result, as described in the [12 June 2020 national guidelines for COVID-19 surveillance](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_12062020_v14_vf.pdf). However, [revised guidelines published on 24 July 2020](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_v15_24072020.pdf) expand the definition of a confirmed COVID-19 case to allow for cases to be confirmed without a PCR test: 

""Confirmed case refers to one of the following 2 options:

Laboratory confirmed case: refers to a person who has had the virus that causes the COVID 19 disease regardless of its clinical signs and symptoms. This confirmation will be done by public and private laboratories that have RT-PCR capable of identifying SARS - CoV-2 and have an authorization from an external regulatory entity such as FDA or its equivalent duly authorized by the Ministry of Health as well as the National Center for Frankincense Virology.

By epidemiological link: persons residing at the address of a laboratory confirmed case who develop respiratory symptoms within 21 days after the first day of isolation. (For these people, it will not be necessary to carry out the PCR-RT test)"" (translated)

For this reason, we do not know how many confirmed cases since 24 July 2020 have been confirmed via ""epidemiological link"" (i.e. without a PCR test). Hence, the time series we construct of the cumulative number of persons tested to date may include a number of confirmed cases that never received a PCR test.

This also means that our testing figures are not an appropriate comparison with cases in these instance. For this reason, we do not calculate the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for Costa Rica.

It does not appear that this change in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, however, since there were no large breaks in the time series coinciding with these changes in terminology.

On 1 November 2020, the Minister of Health announced in a [press release](https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/beros-od-utorka-brzi-antigenski-testovi-uskoro-novo-serolosko-testiranje/30740) that antigen and antibody tests will be used ""to determine how many people in Croatia were in contact with the virus"". However, it is unclear if antigen and antibody tests will be included in testing figures, or if positive results from these tests will be included in confirmed case figures.

The source provides data for both the cumulative number of people tested to date and the number of people tested in the last 24 hours. The daily change in the cumulative number of people tested to date equals the number of people tested in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the cumulative total will repeatedly count people that have undergone more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic.

These report the number and status of confirmed cases, deaths and number of samples tested. This data is available daily from 18 March 2020; reports and infographics prior to this date do not include the number of samples tested. But all figures are dated cumulative since 29 February 2020.

The source reports the number of confirmed ('confirmados') and negative ('descartados') cases, which we sum to get the number of cases tested. The mention of 'cases' suggests that people undergoing multiple rounds of testing over the course of the pandemic may be repeatedly counted. However, no further details are provided by the source.

On 24 April 2020, the number of tests suddenly jumped from 23,383 to 45,857, because of what we assume to be the inclusion of rapid tests (""pruebas rápidas""), as made clear by the subsequent infographic published on 27 April 2020. We therefore do not include the 24 April 2020 infographic in our time series; and from 27 April 2020 onwards, we include only PCR tests.

On 11 May 2020, the Government of Ecuador published a [report](https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BP-VARIACIONES-INFOGRAFIA-No.-074-11052020.pdf) detailing ""a reclassification of the records by identity card of the persons and not by the number of tests that have been carried out"". This suggests the government is moving towards reporting figures on the number of people tested, where previously they reported the number of cases tested. The reclassification partially explains the fall in the cumulative total after 4 May 2020.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source).

Ecuador includes positive antibody tests in their figures for confirmed cases. Our testing figures—which exclude antibody tests—are not an appropriate comparison in these instances: on this basis there could be more cases than tests, which is not possible. For this reason, we do not calculate the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for Ecuador."

This data excludes uninterpretable results and counts the number of tests, not the number of patients tested. The time taken to report back tests may exceed 9 days in some cases. The indicators are adjusted daily according to the reception of the results.

This data does not allow us to publish any cumulative total, since no information is available on how many people had been tested prior to the first day of reporting.

Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures differ from one another by exactly 981 tests on each day, which is due to the fact that many of the 1,041 cumulative persons tested under mandatory quarantine were tested multiple times (2,022 samples tested on 1,041 persons). This discrepancy of 981 tests is small, representing less than 1% of cumulative samples tested at the time. In contrast, the cumulative number of samples tested through routine surveillance and contact tracing are exactly equal to the cumulative number of persons tested on each day in these respective categories.

Prior to 10 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide testing figures using inconsistent terminology, varying between ""samples tested"", ""persons tested"", ""suspected cases tested"", and similar language. Nevertheless, we choose to include all of these figures within our constructed time series, since the variation in terminology does not appear to correspond to large breaks in the time series. In addition, based on the fact that the number of samples tested differs only slightly from the number of persons tested over the 10 May to 26 May 2020 period, we have no reason to believe that the variation in terminology prior to 10 May has any serious ramifications for the interpretation of the time series as the cumulative number of samples tested.

From 10 May 2020 onwards, the daily situation updates consistently report the cumulative number of samples tested."

The press releases from ICMR do not always stay online for very long. The reason for this is unknown, but the releases are being backed up at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datameet/covid19).

On some occasions there appear to have been more than one update released per day. Where we are aware of multiple observations for the day, we show the number for the earlier release.

The ICMR website does not explicitly state whether the reported figures refer to PCR tests only. From contextual information, it appears that the reported figures may also include samples that were tested using a TrueNat non-PCR test. ICMR communications on [21 May 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/press_realease_files/ICMR_Press_Release_TruNat_21052020.pdf) and [19 April 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/labs/Additional_guidance_on_TrueNat_based_COVID19_testing.pdf) indicate that TrueNat tests are being used in diagnostic testing. These TrueNat tests likely account for a small minority of all samples tested.

It is unclear from the source whether or not the cumulative number of people tested repeatedly counts people that have gone through more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. Since we derive a count of the daily number of people tested from the change in this cumulative number, if people undergoing multiple rounds of testing are not counted repeatedly in the cumulative, repeat testers will not appear in our daily testing figures.

No other details are provided.

The press releases from ICMR do not always stay online for very long. The reason for this is unknown, but the releases are being backed up at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datameet/covid19).

On some occasions there appear to have been more than one update released per day. Where we are aware of multiple observations for the day, we show the number for the earlier release.

The ICMR website does not explicitly state whether the reported figures refer to PCR tests only. From contextual information, it appears that the reported figures may also include samples that were tested using a TrueNat non-PCR test. ICMR communications on [21 May 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/press_realease_files/ICMR_Press_Release_TruNat_21052020.pdf) and [19 April 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/labs/Additional_guidance_on_TrueNat_based_COVID19_testing.pdf) indicate that TrueNat tests are being used in diagnostic testing. These TrueNat tests likely account for a small minority of all samples tested.

We found past values using Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The two dashboard URLs ([1](https://infeksiemerging.kemkes.go.id/), [2](https://covid19.kemkes.go.id/)) seem to lead to the exact same dashboard.

The dashboard shows the latest number of ""Kasus dg Spesimen Diperiksa"", which translates to ""Cases with Specimens Checked"".

[Official diagnostic guidelines](https://covid19.kemkes.go.id/download/Pedoman_Penanganan_Cepat_Medis_dan_Kesehatan_Masyarakat_COVID-19_di_Indonesia.pdf.pdf) published on 23 March 2020 provide some reason to be concerned that serological (antibody) tests are included in the cumulative testing figures, stating that:

""Handling of COVID-19 in Indonesia uses antibodies and / or antigen Rapid Tests (RT) in case of contact from a positive patient. RT antibodies are also used for case detection...in areas that do not have facilities for RT-PCR inspection. RT antibody examination results are confirmed using RT-PCR."" (translated)

However, testing figures provided by the [National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure (BNPB)](https://www.bnpb.go.id/) via [twitter](https://twitter.com/bnpb_indonesia?lang=en) explicitly report the number of PCR tests conducted to date, which match the cumulative testing figures provided in the Ministry of Health dashboard. The PCR testing figures reported by the BNPB include a small number of ""rapid molecular tests"" (""Test Cepat Molekular""), which are diagnostic tests not to be confused with serological (antibody) tests. Of 998,406 cumulative people tested as of 11 August 2020, 26,184 (2.6%) were tested via rapid molecular testing ([source](https://twitter.com/BNPB_Indonesia/status/1293105682791542784)). These rapid molecular testing figures are included in the time series we construct.

The BNPB reports, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BNPB_Indonesia/status/1311595072379449346/photo/1), the number of people checked (per day), which is consistent with the cumulative total of ""cases with specimens checked"" reported by the Indonesia Ministry of Health dashboard. This suggests that the cumulative total will repeatedly count people that have undergone more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. However, no further details were provided by the source.

ITA,Italy - people tested,2020-11-28,https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/tree/master/dati-andamento-nazionale,Presidency of the Council of Ministers,Made available by the Department of Civil Protection on GitHub,224,12842250,212.403,112839,1.866,103037,1.704,0.255,3.9,Ministero della Salute,http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=5351&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto,The number of people tested.,"The official data provided by the Ministry of Health is compiled by the Department of Civil Protection on [GitHub](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).

A [conversation on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/issues/864) of the Department of Civil Protection leads us to strongly suspect that people undergoing multiple rounds of testing over the course of the pandemic are not repeatedly counted in these figures. For this reason, since 23 October 2020 we use the ""tests performed"" series as our series of reference for Italy's testing data.

This figure is available for each individual region separately at the source indicated. However it appears that data is missing for individual regions for particular dates – we assume that these are also missing from the aggregate total for Italy that we provide. The list of missing data, in English, can be seen at the bottom of [this data dashboard built by Franco Mossotto](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/91350339-2c97-49b5-92b8-965996530f00/page/RdlHB). 

It is clear that there are delays in timeline running up to a test being reported – both in terms of the time it takes for a symptomatic person to receive a test, and in the time for that test to then get reported in the data. For one region, Lombardy, [an investigation](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.09320.pdf) found the latter delay in the early period of the outbreak to be around 3-4 days.

There is significant variation in testing practices – in terms of how many tests are conducted and how they are allocated across the population – across regions and these practices have also changed over time. The extent to which tests pending results are included appears to vary across regions.

The tweets and press releases usually report testing figures in terms of the number of ""samples tested"". However, the wording used in some tweets and press releases makes it unclear whether the figures relate to the number of samples tested or the number of people tested. For example, the relevant tweet on [4 June 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1268563481235787776) says ""2,640 samples tested in the last 24 hours"", while the relevant tweet on [1 August 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1289552051916009475) states that ""727 people are the latest to test positive for Covid-19 from a sample of 6,371 tested in the last 24 hrs"". It does not appear that this inconsistency in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, since there are no large breaks in the time series that correspond to the use of ""samples tested"" versus ""people tested"" terminology. Instead, the wording of the tweets and press releases suggests that the reported number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested.

This figure can be found in the infographic titled 'Jumlah Keseluruhan Taburan Kes COVID-19 di Malaysia' labelled as 'Jumlah Individu Disampel'. Since 19 April 2020, we are not aware of this source reporting positive, negative, and pending test figures separately, as was the case before.

It is unclear from the source whether or not the cumulative number of individuals sampled repeatedly counts people that have gone through more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic. Since we derive a count of the daily number of people tested from the change in this cumulative number, if people undergoing multiple rounds of testing are not counted repeatedly in the cumulative, repeat testers will not appear in our daily testing figures.

The situation updates for 27/28 May 2020 and 2 June 2020 onwards do not include the infographic detailing the total number of people tested. In these instances, we rely on the MOH daily press conference livestreams uploaded to the official Facebook page. The sum of positive and negative tests reported in the livestream match the total people tested figures reported in the situation updates.

For 14/15 May 2020, we use the Director General of Health, [daily press statement figures](https://kpkesihatan.com/2020/05/15/kenyataan-akhbar-kpk-15-mei-2020-situasi-semasa-jangkitan-penyakit-coronavirus-2019-covid-19-di-malaysia/). It details the jump in people tested from 14th to 15th May was due to data consolidation efforts and an improved data collection system.

Prior to 19 May 2020, we relied on MOH web archives to reconstruct the time series. The MOH provided daily updates to the total number of cases tested. It is not clear the exact date these cumulative figures date back to. The earliest release we have been able to find begins from the 14 February 2020. This MOH web archive provides a breakdown of the number of positive, negative, and still pending tests. We report total tests as the sum of positive and negative tests, excluding pending tests. The title of the table indicates that these figures relate to cases. As far as we are aware, cases are equivalent to individuals tested.

In a previous version of this page, we reported total tests as the sum of positive, negative, and pending tests. However, since 7 April 2020, the source has not reported the number of pending tests each day. For this reason, we have updated the time series so that total tests is equal to the sum of positive and negative tests (excluding pending tests) for all days on which we report data.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source)."

They note that the total includes “repeated samples,” and likely also includes pending tests. This is our source starting 26 June 2020.

Before 26 June 2020, our source was daily update videos posted to the Maldives Ministry of Health [official Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthMV). Toward the end of these videos they report the number of positive, pending, and total “Laboratory Sample[s]” tested; before 16 June 2020 the number of negative samples was also reported. The positive, negative, and total numbers are cumulative, while the pending numbers are current as of that day.

From 16–25 June 2020, we used the reported total, which likely includes pending tests. Before the 16th when negative numbers were reported, we used the total of positive and negative numbers rather than the reported total, since the latter generally included pending values and occasionally contained discrepant numbers that did not match any combination of the positive, negative, or pending numbers. It is not clear when testing first began; data is only available from 16 March 2020 where it was reported that 221 tests had been conducted.

For example, the [11 October 2020 situation report](http://www.sante.gov.mr/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/111020-Mauritanie-Sitrep-COVID-19_FR-.pdf) states: ""91 tests performed today including 83 diagnostic tests"" (translated).

The files can be downloaded in CSV format.

To arrive at the time series shown on our website, we use the CSV files for confirmed cases (""confirmados"") and negative cases (""negativos""). For each file, we only keep the row that reports national data, merge the two files together, and add up confirmed and negative cases to find the number of people tested each day.

There are, however, very large delays in the reporting of test results. We investigated these delays in November 2020, and found that it takes up to 3 weeks for the number of tests on a given day to become 95% complete ([more information can be found in this series of tweets in Spanish](https://twitter.com/redouad/status/1331573167719145472)). Because of this, we remove the last 21 days of data to avoid showing a large decrease in the number of tests, and thus an overestimated positive rate.

On November 22nd, the Ministry of Health announced in a [press conference](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/articulos/version-estenografica-conferencia-de-prensa-informe-diario-sobre-coronavirus-covid-19-en-mexico-257772?idiom=es) that antigen tests can now be used to confirm cases of COVID-19. They also established that antigen tests are now included in testing figures. A [press release](https://www.gob.mx/salud/prensa/188-prueba-diagnostica-de-pcr-garantiza-un-resultado-confiable-de-covid-19?idiom=es) on Nov 5th confirmed that antibody tests are neither used for case confirmation nor included in testing and case figures.

Two pieces of evidence suggest that people undergoing multiple rounds of testing over the course of the pandemic may be counted each round: 1) Figures refer to the number of cases tested, and each case has a unique ID; and 2) The source provides the number of cases with samples tested in the past 24 hours, which matches the daily change in the cumulative number of cases tested.

Data starts on 1 January 2020; we do not know if this is because tests started on that date or because earlier data is not available."

We construct a time series of the cumulative total number of cases tested to date using updates from the Ministry of Health's official Twitter page, ([@Ministere_Sante](https://twitter.com/Ministere_Sante)). There are usually two updates per day, and we use the later one. The earliest reported numbers are from 7 February 2020, at which point 9 cases had been tested.

The number of positive cases registered and the total number of negative tests is equal to the number of total tests conducted for the majority of the daily reports released. For dates where this is not the case, we favour the sum of positive cases registered and the number of negative tests.

From 3 October 2020, the MOH no longer reports the number of negative tests. Instead, it reports the number of tests in the last 24 hours and the cumulative number of tests.

There are reports published prior to the 28 March (the earliest we could find is dated 18 March 2020) that include the number of positive and negative tests conducted by the National Institute of Health or in private laboratories. However, the cumulative totals for 26 and 27 March 2020 are inconsistent with the cumulative total reported for the 28 March 2020 onwards. Therefore, to avoid potential inconsistenies with the series from 28 March 2020, we do not include these testing figures."

The reports contain a time series of the number of persons tested per week since 9 March 2020.

Since the source provides figures for the number of people tested per week, we take this to mean that people that have undergone more than one round of testing in different weeks over the course of the outbreak will be counted repeatedly. Our cumulative figures for testing are calculated by summing the weekly figures together. As such they will include duplicates for people undergoing multiple rounds of testing.

There appear to be large reporting lags, such that the number of labs reporting for days in recent weeks tend to be lower. As a result, the reported figures are updated retrospectively as additional labs report their results. The figures we display are based on the latest available epidemiological report, but we currently censor the last month of data to avoid showing an artificially low number of tests (and therefore an overestimated positive rate).

The epidemiological reports state that 'all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March 2020 to report these data daily.'

We were alerted by a Technical Advisor within the Cabinet of the Secretary of Health to the fact that these figures only captures people who were reported through the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance which does not include many of the people that get tested but are never entered into the surveillance system (because they do not meet the criteria and go on to test negatively). For this reason we have now switched to the current series. The advisor confirmed to us that this series: includes all the public, private and university labs performing SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in Portugal; does not include tests pending results.

Since October 2020, rapid antigen tests are also being performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in Portugal.

Since 23 September 2020, due to a change in format on the Korean CDC website, we collect our data from the website of the [Ministry of Health and Welfare](http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/) dedicated to COVID-19. The data shown by the Korean CDC and the Ministry of Health and Welfare is perfectly identical.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source)."
ESP,Spain - tests performed,2020-11-19,https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/COVID-19_pruebas_diagnosticas_19_11_2020.pdf,"Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare",,32,17249511,368.936,,,146855,3.141,0.102,9.8,"Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social",https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/situacionActual.htm,The number of tests performed.,"We construct a time series of the cumulative number of PCR tests performed to date based on weekly press releases from the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare. We do not include the daily data published in [daily updates](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/situacionActual.htm) due to persistent reporting lags. Furthermore, there appear to be reporting lags in the weekly reports, such that the figures for any given week increase the following week, and so recent values for the Positive Rate may be slightly overestimated. Figures are retrospectively revised once a week with the latest figures as additional labs report their results.

The first estimate in our time series (13 April 2020) comes from a Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare [press release](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&id=4864), quoting Salvador Illa (Minister of Health): ""From the beginning of the crisis and until April 13, the total number of PCR carried out in Spain is 930,230."" The second estimate in our time series comes from a 27 April 2020 press release from the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare, relating to testing conducted up to 23 April 2020. The press release provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total of 1,035,522 PCR tests conducted nationwide. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. Antibody tests differ from PCR tests, [as we discuss](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19). Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide data that is most comparable to other countries in our database, we only include the PCR testing figures.

One aspect of the 27 April 2020 press release that is not entirely clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to 23 April 2020. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health press release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April 2020) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update—ostensibly dating to the 23 April 2020—may date back to 14 April 2020.

[CIVIO](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/pcr-coronavirus-covid19-espana-comunidades-autonomas/) is a non-profit investigative data journalism organisation who are collating information on tests performed within each Autonomous Community, as released through official channels (communication offices, web pages, press releases and social networks of the different regions).

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source).

Daily case reports (e.g. [5 August 2020](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_178_COVID-19.pdf)) published by the Ministry of Health note that ""total cases [are] confirmed by PCR until 10 May, and by PCR and IgM (only if compatible symptoms) according to the new surveillance strategy from 11 May"".

This could have indicated that Spain included positive antibody tests in their figures for confirmed cases. As we explain in [this FAQ](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#why-do-you-not-report-the-positive-rate-or-tests-per-case-for-all-countries-in-the-dataset), we do not present figures for the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for countries where we believe this to be the case.

However, this footnote importantly says that positive IgM results are only counted if they have ""compatible symptoms"", i.e. if patients are actively infected by the virus.

[This report](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf) published on 9 July 2020 also makes clear on page 4 that IgM tests included in new confirmed cases do not correspond to massive serology testing for past infections, but rather to active, symptomatic infections with a negative PCR result but for which further IgM testing came back positive.

In the same way, the documentation published by the Carlos III Health Institute on [its COVID-19 website](https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/#documentaci%C3%B3n-y-datos) states that ""as of May 11, the Ministry of Health is counting the confirmed cases diagnosed by PCR (and in some specific cases those diagnosed by IgM by ELISA)"", i.e. the inclusion of IgM does not mean the inclusion of massive antibody testing results, but rather specific instances where current infections are confirmed via IgM instead of PCR.

Pending new information that would prove otherwise, we therefore do not exclude Spain from the calculation of the positive rate and number of tests per case, as IgM tests for active cases represent a very small number and therefore should not affect these ratios."

It is unclear whether the reported figures include tests pending results.

In the daily snapshots, the wording used to report the cumulative testing figures does not make it clear as to whether the reported figures relate to the number of tests performed or the number of persons tested. For example, the cumulative testing figure reported on 6 August 2020 is ""1,116,641 tested"" (translated from ""протестовано""). The [english version](https://covid19.gov.ua/en) of the same page reports the same figure as ""total of tests"", which is also unclear. [A more detailed dashboard](https://covid19.gov.ua/analitichni-paneli-dashbordy) on the same web domain provides testing figures in downloadable csv files dating back to 1 June 2020, where each csv file contains separate columns for the cumulative number of PCR tests and non-PCR tests. The cumulative PCR testing figures reported in these csv files are described as ""The number of laboratory tests performed by PCR on COVID-19"" (""Кількість проведених лабораторних досліджень методом ПЛР на COVID-19""), making it clear that the figures refer to the number of tests performed (which may or may not be equivalent to the number of people tested).

The cumulative PCR testing figures provided in the csv files tend to be approximately 2% smaller than the testing figures provided in the daily snapshots. Nevertheless, we assume that this discrepancy is due to small differences in the reference date, reporting laboratories included, or other minor details, rather than the possibility that the daily snapshot figures include non-PCR tests or refer to a metric other than the number of tests performed. The cumulative number of non-PCR tests reported in the csv files are much larger than the size of this discrepancy.

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

As of 26 May 2020, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests – as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because some states do not disaggregate these types of tests we are not currently able to exclude the antibody tests.

Other differences across states include: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

VNM,Vietnam - samples tested,2020-10-15,http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/phong-chong-dich-benh-viem-phoi-cap-ncov/14099/ban-tin-cap-nhat-dich-benh-covid-19-ngay-15-10-2020,Vietnam General Department of Preventive Medicine,,83,1260799,12.953,3009,0.031,2394,0.025,0.001,1000,Vietnam General Department of Preventive Medicine,http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/search?page=1&keyword=covid-19,The number of samples tested.,"The Vietnam General Department of Preventive Medicine provides daily COVID-19 bulletins that periodically report the cumulative number of samples tested to date. The bulletins extend back to 13 February 2020. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that 856 samples had been tested as of 13 February 2020.

We have been unable to find testing figures in any of the bulletins published between 29 April 2020 and 28 July 2020, with the exception of a 4 July 2020 bulletin reporting that 379,701 samples had been tested to date. From 29 July 2020 onwards, the bulletins make it clear that the testing figures relate to PCR tests only.

Some bulletins report the cumulative number of people tested alongside the cumulative number of samples tested. Oddly, the cumulative number of people tested is larger than the cumulative number of samples tested. For example, [the 18 September 2020 bulletin](http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/phong-chong-dich-benh-viem-phoi-cap-ncov/14061/ban-tin-cap-nhat-dich-benh-covid-19-ngay-18-9-2020) reports 1,183,341 samples tested to date using PCR, while at the same time reporting 1,358,575 people tested to date. One possibility is that the reported number of people tested includes people tested using methods other than PCR. For this reason, we exclude the figures on the cumulative number of people tested from our dataset.

Bulletins published between 13 February 2020 and 28 April 2020 report the cumulative number of samples tested to date alongside the cumulative number of samples with positive test results and the cumulative number of samples with negative test results, which suggests that in this time period the total number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it is unclear whether samples with negative test results include instances of resampling for the same person.

ZMB,Zambia - tests performed,2020-11-28,https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19,Government of Zambia,,233,394420,21.455,5958,0.324,4768,0.259,0.006,166.7,Zambia Ministry of Health,https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19,The number of tests performed.,"The Zambia Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Zambia Statistics Agency, provides a time series of the number of samples tested each day since 19 March 2020 in an [official dashboard](https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19).

The dashboard data is sourced from daily reports produced by the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.zm/) (published on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mohzambia) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mohzambia) pages) and the [Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)](https://znphi.co.zm/news/situation-reports-new-coronavirus-covid-19-sitreps). 

To ensure accuracy, we have cross-checked a sample of the dashboard figures against the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI reports.

Official reports from the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI use the terminology ""tests conducted"" and ""samples tested"" interchangeably over time, with no indication that the choice of terminology represents a substantive difference in the reported figures.

The reported figures that are based on ZNPHI reports exclude pending test results, while it is unclear whether the reported figures from the Ministry of Health reports exclude pending test results. Nevertheless, pending test results represent a small fraction of overall tests, so this possible discrepancy is of minor consequence."
ZWE,Zimbabwe - tests performed,2020-11-26,https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim/status/1332088717406777345,Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care,,202,164619,11.076,1770,0.119,1040,0.07,0.079,12.7,Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care,http://www.mohcc.gov.zw,The number of tests performed.,"The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care provides daily press releases on its website and Twitter account ([@MoHCCZim](https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim)) that report the cumulative number of tests performed to date. The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results.

The press release for 6 May 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 ""rapid screening"" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.

Prior to 6 May 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on 6 May 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source)."
