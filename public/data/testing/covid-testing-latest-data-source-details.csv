According to the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf), dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling). 

It is unclear whether the testing figures include technologies other than PCR tests. In a communication on 3 April 2020, Sciensano indicates that an antigen test made by Coris Bioconcept may now be used for COVID-19 detection. The communication states that positive antigen test results do not have to be confirmed by a PCR test, but that negative or doubtful cases must be confirmed by a PCR test.

Official figures reported in Sciensano's daily epidemiological bulletins do not help to clarify whether non-PCR tests are included in the daily time series figures. For example, as of 10 May 2020, the [official time series dataset](https://epistat.sciensano.be/covid/covid19_historicaldata.html) reported a cumulative total of 465,201 tests performed between 1 March and 9 May 2020. However, the epidemiological bulletin for [10 May 2020](https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_Daily%20report_20200510%20-%20FR.pdf) states that 325,796 cumulative tests had been performed by laboratories between the beginning of March and 9 May 2020, while an additional 240,305 tests had been performed through the national testing platform (566,101 total tests).

The bulletin indicates that these figures include both PCR and antigen tests, suggesting that the large discrepancy between the 465,201 figure and the combined 566,101 figure may be due to the fact that the official time series data only includes PCR tests, whereas the official bulletin figures include both PCR and antigen tests. However, we have been unable to find official documentation from Sciensano that resolves this ambiguity."

The briefs often (but do not always) provide a breakdown of the cumulative number of confirmed, suspected, and negative (also called discarded) tests to date. We measure the total number of tests performed to date as the sum of the number of confirmed and negative tests.

Because of the way the daily briefs report the number of negative tests (""pruebas negativas"") alongside the number of positive cases (""casos positivos""), it may be the case that the number of tests performed is equivalent to the number of people tested.

The reported number of tests performed may include non-PCR tests. [Official protocol for COVID-19 laboratory diagnosis](https://www.minsalud.gob.bo/component/jdownloads/download/30-guias-manejo-covid/445-protocolo-para-el-diagnostico-de-laboratorio-en-el-marco-de-la-emergencia-sanitaria-por-covid-actualizado?Itemid=646) (updated in May 2020) indicate that antibody (non-PCR) tests are an important aspect of the country's screening and diagnostic process (e.g. see pages 24-27 and annex 2). But the source does not explicitly state whether these non-PCR tests are used to confirm or discard suspected cases without a corresponding PCR test result.

As of 5 August 2020, the most recent daily briefs consistently report testing figures in terms of the cumulative number of tests (""pruebas"") performed. However, in the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily briefs previously reported testing figures using inconsistent terminology such as samples (“muestras”) tested, people who have undergone tests (”personas, que fueron sometidas a pruebas”), and tests (""pruebas"") performed. It does not appear that this inconsistent use of terminology reflects a substantive change in the reported figures, since there are no corresponding large breaks in the time series.

In 10 briefs the number of negative tests was not reported, preventing us from calculating a total for that date. For these dates with missing official data, we use data provided in this [unofficial GitHub repository](https://github.com/mauforonda/covid19-bolivia), which we have cross-referenced against the official data for all dates.

These updates state the daily number of people who have been tested – given as the number of confirmed cases (‘Confirma contagio’) and number of people with negative results (‘Descarta contagio’) (thus the figures do not include pending tests). We use these daily updates to construct a full time series of the cumulative number of persons tested to date. These figures have been collected and are made available for download by the news website [El Observador](https://observador.cr/covid19-estadisticas/), from which we take our data.

Daily testing figures are only available since 11 March 2020. We therefore do not know the first date of testing, or daily figures prior to this date.

For the number of new tests reported on 25 March 2020, we noticed a discrepancy between data published by El Observador and the official data reported by the Ministry of Health. We therefore replaced the number of discarded tests for that day (5) with the official number (65) (official reports: [24 March 2020](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/img_cvd/img_datos_marzo_2020_14.jpeg), [25 March 2020](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/img_cvd/img_datos_marzo_2020_15.jpeg)).

Prior to 24 July 2020, suspected COVID-19 cases in Costa Rica could only be confirmed via a positive PCR test result, as described in the [12 June 2020 national guidelines for COVID-19 surveillance](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_12062020_v14_vf.pdf).

""Confirmed case refers to one of the following 2 options:

Laboratory confirmed case: refers to a person who has had the virus that causes the COVID 19 disease regardless of its clinical signs and symptoms. This confirmation will be done by public and private laboratories that have RT-PCR capable of identifying SARS - CoV-2 and have an authorization from an external regulatory entity such as FDA or its equivalent duly authorized by the Ministry of Health as well as the National Center for Frankincense Virology.

By epidemiological link: persons residing at the address of a laboratory confirmed case who develop respiratory symptoms within 21 days after the first day of isolation. (For these people, it will not be necessary to carry out the PCR-RT test)"" (translated)

For this reason, we do not know how many confirmed cases since 24 July 2020 have been confirmed via ""epidemiological link"" (i.e. without a PCR test). Hence, the time series we construct of the cumulative number of persons tested to date may include a number of confirmed cases that never received a PCR test.

This also means that our testing figures are not an appropriate comparison with cases in these instance. For this reason, we do not calculate the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for Costa Rica.

These report the number and status of confirmed cases, deaths and number of samples tested. This data is available daily from 18 March 2020; reports and infographics prior to this date do not include the number of samples tested. But all figures are dated cumulative since 29 February 2020.

The source reports the number of confirmed ('confirmados') and negative ('descartados') cases, which we sum to get the number of cases tested.

On 24 April 2020, the number of tests suddenly jumped from 23,383 to 45,857, because of what we assume to be the inclusion of rapid tests (""pruebas rápidas""), as made clear by the subsequent infographic published on 27 April 2020. We therefore do not include the 24 April 2020 infographic in our time series; and from 27 April 2020 onwards, we include only PCR tests.

On 11 May 2020, the Government of Ecuador published a [report](https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BP-VARIACIONES-INFOGRAFIA-No.-074-11052020.pdf) detailing ""a reclassification of the records by identity card of the persons and not by the number of tests that have been carried out"". This suggests the government is moving towards reporting figures on the number of people tested, where previously they reported the number of cases tested. The reclassification partially explains the fall in the cumulative total after 4 May 2020.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source).

Ecuador includes positive antibody tests in their figures for confirmed cases. Our testing figures—which exclude antibody tests—are not an appropriate comparison in these instances: on this basis there could be more cases than tests, which is not possible. For this reason, we do not calculate the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for Ecuador."

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures differ from one another by exactly 981 tests on each day, which is due to the fact that many of the 1,041 cumulative persons tested under mandatory quarantine were tested multiple times (2,022 samples tested on 1,041 persons). This discrepancy of 981 tests is small, representing less than 1% of cumulative samples tested at the time. In contrast, the cumulative number of samples tested through routine surveillance and contact tracing are exactly equal to the cumulative number of persons tested on each day in these respective categories.

Prior to 10 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide testing figures using inconsistent terminology, varying between ""samples tested"", ""persons tested"", ""suspected cases tested"", and similar language. Nevertheless, we choose to include all of these figures within our constructed time series, since the variation in terminology does not appear to correspond to large breaks in the time series. In addition, based on the fact that the number of samples tested differs only slightly from the number of persons tested over the 10 May to 26 May 2020 period, we have no reason to believe that the variation in terminology prior to 10 May has any serious ramifications for the interpretation of the time series as the cumulative number of samples tested.

From 10 May 2020 onwards, the daily situation updates consistently report the cumulative number of samples tested."

The tweets and press releases usually report testing figures in terms of the number of ""samples tested"". However, the wording used in some tweets and press releases makes it unclear whether the figures relate to the number of samples tested or the number of people tested. For example, the relevant tweet on [4 June 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1268563481235787776) says ""2,640 samples tested in the last 24 hours"", while the relevant tweet on [1 August 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1289552051916009475) states that ""727 people are the latest to test positive for Covid-19 from a sample of 6,371 tested in the last 24 hrs"". It does not appear that this inconsistency in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, since there are no large breaks in the time series that correspond to the use of ""samples tested"" versus ""people tested"" terminology. Instead, the wording of the tweets and press releases suggests that the reported number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested.

The NCDC dashboard only displays a snapshot of the cumulative testing figure as of today, rather than a complete time series of the number of samples tested each day. Nevertheless, the daily time series is available via the dashboard at [this API endpoint](https://services3.arcgis.com/CoIPqtHxRZqBsYyb/arcgis/rest/services/%D9%86%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B0%D8%AC_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%86%D9%89_2view2/FeatureServer/0/query?f=json&where=1%3D1&returnGeometry=false&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&outFields=*&orderByFields=field_2%20asc&resultOffset=0&resultRecordCount=32000&resultType=standard&cacheHint=true). The daily testing figures are stored in ""field_3"" of the resulting JSON data. Although ""field_3"" is defined as ""suspected cases"" (""الحالات المشتبهة""), the figures reported in this field align with the testing figures reported in daily situation reports published on the [NCDC Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NCDC.LY).

The time series of daily testing figures that we construct from the NCDC dashboard is missing data for a small number of days, such that the time series slightly underestimates the true cumulative number of samples tested to date.

It is unclear whether the reported figures include pending test results.

Note that the testing figures reported in the NCDC dashboard do not match the cumulative testing figures reported in the [WHO Libya COVID-19 situation reports](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/operations/libya/search?search=COVID-19+Situation+) that are published periodically. For example, the [2 September 2020 situation report](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/libya_covid_update_14_final.pdf) claims that a total of 134,027 samples were tested as of 2 September 2020, whereas the time series we construct from the NCDC dashboard yields a cumulative total of 138,487 samples tested as of 2 September 2020. We are unsure of the reasons for this discrepancy.

The earliest reported figure in the official NCDC dashboard is from 4 March 2020 (3 samples tested). It is unclear how many samples were tested before this date."

The title of the table indicates that these figures relate to cases. As far as we are aware, cases are equivalent to individuals tested.

In a previous version of this page, we reported total tests as the sum of positive, negative, and pending tests. However, since 7 April 2020, the source has not reported the number of pending tests each day. For this reason, we have updated the time series so that total tests is equal to the sum of positive and negative tests (excluding pending tests) for all days on which we report data.

The dashboard shows the cumulative number of total, positive (""positivas""), negative (""negativas""), and control tests (""prueba de control"") performed. We report here the total of positive and negative numbers because: 1) the time series only includes positive and negative test numbers; and 2) the total they provide seems to include control tests, which we understand to be used for testing quality control.

ESP,Spain - tests performed,2020-09-24,https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/COVID-19_pruebas_diagnosticas_24_09_2020.pdf,"Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare",,24,9333212,199.62,,,107213,2.293,0.105,9.553,"Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social",https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do,The number of tests performed.,"We construct a time series of the cumulative number of tests performed to date using weekly press releases from the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare. In the current week, we supplement this time series with provisional daily data on the number of PCR tests performed, published in [daily updates](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/situacionActual.htm) by the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare. Once the official weekly figure becomes available for the current week, we remove the provisional daily figures from our dataset.

The first estimate in our time series (13 April 2020) comes from a Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare [press release](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&id=4864), quoting Salvador Illa (Minister of Health): ""From the beginning of the crisis and until April 13, the total number of PCR carried out in Spain is 930,230."" The second estimate in our time series comes from a 27 April 2020 press release from the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare, relating to testing conducted up to 23 April 2020. The press release provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total of 1,035,522 PCR tests conducted nationwide. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. Antibody tests differ from PCR tests, [as we discuss](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19). Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide data that is most comparable to other countries in our database, we only include the PCR testing figures.

One aspect of the 27 April 2020 press release that is not entirely clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to 23 April 2020. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health press release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April 2020) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update—ostensibly dating to the 23 April 2020—may date back to 14 April 2020.

[CIVIO](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/pcr-coronavirus-covid19-espana-comunidades-autonomas/) is a non-profit investigative data journalism organisation who are collating information on tests performed within each Autonomous Community, as released through official channels (communication offices, web pages, press releases and social networks of the different regions).

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source).

Daily case reports (e.g. [5 August 2020](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_178_COVID-19.pdf)) published by the Ministry of Health note that ""total cases [are] confirmed by PCR until 10 May, and by PCR and IgM (only if compatible symptoms) according to the new surveillance strategy from 11 May"".

This could have indicated that Spain included positive antibody tests in their figures for confirmed cases. As we explain in [this FAQ](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#why-do-you-not-report-the-positive-rate-or-tests-per-case-for-all-countries-in-the-dataset), we do not present figures for the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for countries where we believe this to be the case.

However, this footnote importantly says that positive IgM results are only counted if they have ""compatible symptoms"", i.e. if patients are actively infected by the virus.

[This report](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf) published on 9 July 2020 also makes clear on page 4 that IgM tests included in new confirmed cases do not correspond to massive serology testing for past infections, but rather to active, symptomatic infections with a negative PCR result but for which further IgM testing came back positive.

In the same way, the documentation published by the Carlos III Health Institute on [its COVID-19 website](https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/#documentaci%C3%B3n-y-datos) states that ""as of May 11, the Ministry of Health is counting the confirmed cases diagnosed by PCR (and in some specific cases those diagnosed by IgM by ELISA)"", i.e. the inclusion of IgM does not mean the inclusion of massive antibody testing results, but rather specific instances where current infections are confirmed via IgM instead of PCR.

Pending new information that would prove otherwise, we therefore do not exclude Spain from the calculation of the positive rate and number of tests per case, as IgM tests for active cases represent a very small number and therefore should not affect these ratios."

In the daily snapshots, the wording used to report the cumulative testing figures does not make it clear as to whether the reported figures relate to the number of tests performed or the number of persons tested. For example, the cumulative testing figure reported on 6 August 2020 is ""1,116,641 tested"" (translated from ""протестовано""). The [english version](https://covid19.gov.ua/en) of the same page reports the same figure as ""total of tests"", which is also unclear. [A more detailed dashboard](https://covid19.gov.ua/analitichni-paneli-dashbordy) on the same web domain provides testing figures in downloadable csv files dating back to 1 June 2020, where each csv file contains separate columns for the cumulative number of PCR tests and non-PCR tests.

The cumulative PCR testing figures provided in the csv files tend to be approximately 2% smaller than the testing figures provided in the daily snapshots. Nevertheless, we assume that this discrepancy is due to small differences in the reference date, reporting laboratories included, or other minor details, rather than the possibility that the daily snapshot figures include non-PCR tests or refer to a metric other than the number of tests performed.

As of 26 May 2020, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests – as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because some states do not disaggregate these types of tests we are not currently able to exclude the antibody tests.

Other differences across states include: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."

These figures are also made available on the [Sistema Nacional de Emergencias dashboard](https://www.gub.uy/sistema-nacional-emergencias/pagina-embebida/visualizador-casos-coronavirus-covid-19-uruguay), in which the figures are presented as the number of tests processed since 13 March 2020 (""Desde el 13 de marzo se han procesado: [N] test"").

We previously reported testing data from a [dashboard maintained by El Observador](https://observador.cr/covid19-estadisticas/), but on 20 April 2020 we replaced the entire time series based on the reports from the Ministry of Health.

The dashboard referred to its testing data as 'samples tested'. This figure generally matches the sum of confirmed cases and negative samples, suggesting that the total number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested  (there are occasionally small discrepancies – we report the sum of positive and negative in these cases). However, it is unclear whether 'negative samples' includes instances of resampling for the same person.

Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples tested. These daily updates extend back to 2 March 2020. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that 1,753 samples had been tested as of 2 March 2020. More recently the website stopped updating its testing data, and finally stopped reporting the figures altogether. The last date we were able to collect testing data was on the 29 April 2020.

The dashboard data is sourced from daily reports produced by the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.zm/) (published on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mohzambia) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mohzambia) pages) and the [Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)](https://znphi.co.zm/news/situation-reports-new-coronavirus-covid-19-sitreps). 

To ensure accuracy, we have cross-checked a sample of the dashboard figures against the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI reports.

Official reports from the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI use the terminology ""tests conducted"" and ""samples tested"" interchangeably over time, with no indication that the choice of terminology represents a substantive difference in the reported figures.

The reported figures that are based on ZNPHI reports exclude pending test results, while it is unclear whether the reported figures from the Ministry of Health reports exclude pending test results. Nevertheless, pending test results represent a small fraction of overall tests, so this possible discrepancy is of minor consequence."

The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results.

The press release for 6 May 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 ""rapid screening"" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.

Prior to 6 May 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on 6 May 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests.
