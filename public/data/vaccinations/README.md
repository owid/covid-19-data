# Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccinations by _Our World in Data_

For more general information on our COVID-19 data, see our main README file in [`/public/data`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).


## Country metadata

Stored in [`locations.csv`](locations.csv)

* `location`: name of the country (or region within a country).
* `iso_code`: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter country codes.
* `vaccines`: list of vaccines administered in the country up to the current date.
* `last_observation_date`: date of the last observation in our data.
* `source_name`: name of our source for data collection.
* `source_website`: web location of our source. It can be a standard URL if numbers are consistently reported on a given page; otherwise it will be the source for the last data point.


## Vaccination data

Stored in [`vaccinations.csv`](vaccinations.csv)

* `location`: name of the country (or region within a country).
* `iso_code`: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter country codes.
* `date`: date of the observation.
* `total_vaccinations`: total number of doses administered. This is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses). If a person receives one dose of the vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive a second dose, it goes up by 1 again.
* `total_vaccinations_per_hundred`: `total_vaccinations` per 100 people in the total population of the country.
* `daily_vaccinations`: new doses administered per day (7-day smoothed). For countries that don't report data on a daily basis, we assume that doses changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window.
* `daily_vaccinations_per_million`: `daily_vaccinations` per 1,000,000 people in the total population of the country.
* `people_vaccinated`: total number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive the second dose, the metric stays the same.
* `people_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the country.
* `people_fully_vaccinated`: total number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric stays the same. If they receive the second dose, the metric goes up by 1.
* `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_fully_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the country.

Note: for `people_vaccinated` and `people_fully_vaccinated` we are dependent on the necessary data being made available, so we may not be able to make these metrics available for some countries.


### An example of how we calculate our metrics

4 people take part in a vaccination program, to be given a vaccine that requires 2 doses to be effective against the disease.

* Dina has received 2 doses;
* Joel has received 1 dose;
* Tommy has received 1 dose;
* Ellie has not received any dose.

In our data:

* The total number of doses administered (`total_vaccinations`) will be equal to `4` (2 + 1 + 1);
* The total number of people vaccinated (`people_vaccinated`) will be equal to `3` (Dina, Joel, Tommy);
* The total number of people fully vaccinated (`people_fully_vaccinated`) will be equal to `1` (Dina).
