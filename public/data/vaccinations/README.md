# Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccinations by _Our World in Data_

For more general information on our COVID-19 data, see our main README file in [`/public/data`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).


## Global vaccination data

### Country metadata

Stored in [`locations.csv`](locations.csv)

* `location`: name of the country (or region within a country).
* `iso_code`: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter country codes.
* `vaccines`: list of vaccines administered in the country up to the current date.
* `last_observation_date`: date of the last observation in our data.
* `source_name`: name of our source for data collection.
* `source_website`: web location of our source. It can be a standard URL if numbers are consistently reported on a given page; otherwise it will be the source for the last data point.

### Vaccination data

Stored in [`vaccinations.csv`](vaccinations.csv). Country-by-country data on global COVID-19 vaccinations. We only rely on figures that are verifiable based on public official sources.

The population estimates we use to calculate per-capita metrics are all based on the last revision of the [United Nations World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/). The exact values can be viewed [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/scripts/input/un/population_2020.csv).

* `location`: name of the country (or region within a country).
* `iso_code`: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter country codes.
* `date`: date of the observation.
* `total_vaccinations`: total number of doses administered. This is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses). If a person receives one dose of the vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive a second dose, it goes up by 1 again.
* `total_vaccinations_per_hundred`: `total_vaccinations` per 100 people in the total population of the country.
* `daily_vaccinations_raw`: daily change in the total number of doses administered. It is only calculated for consecutive days. This is a raw measure provided for data checks and transparency, but we strongly recommend that any analysis on daily vaccination rates be conducted using `daily_vaccinations` instead.
* `daily_vaccinations`: new doses administered per day (7-day smoothed). For countries that don't report data on a daily basis, we assume that doses changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window. An example of how we perform this calculation can be found [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/333#issuecomment-763015298).
* `daily_vaccinations_per_million`: `daily_vaccinations` per 1,000,000 people in the total population of the country.
* `people_vaccinated`: total number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive the second dose, the metric stays the same.
* `people_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the country.
* `people_fully_vaccinated`: total number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric stays the same. If they receive the second dose, the metric goes up by 1.
* `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_fully_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the country.

Note: for `people_vaccinated` and `people_fully_vaccinated` we are dependent on the necessary data being made available, so we may not be able to make these metrics available for some countries.



## United States vaccination data

Stored in [`us_state_vaccinations.csv`](us_state_vaccinations.csv). State-by-state data on United States COVID-19 vaccinations. We rely on the data updated daily by the [United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations).

* `location`: name of the state or federal entity.
* `date`: date of the observation.
* `total_vaccinations`: total number of doses administered. This is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses). If a person receives one dose of the vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive a second dose, it goes up by 1 again.
* `total_vaccinations_per_hundred`: `total_vaccinations` per 100 people in the total population of the state.
* `daily_vaccinations_raw`: daily change in the total number of doses administered. It is only calculated for consecutive days. This is a raw measure provided for data checks and transparency, but we strongly recommend that any analysis on daily vaccination rates be conducted using `daily_vaccinations` instead.
* `daily_vaccinations`: new doses administered per day (7-day smoothed). For countries that don't report data on a daily basis, we assume that doses changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window. An example of how we perform this calculation can be found [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/333#issuecomment-763015298).
* `daily_vaccinations_per_million`: `daily_vaccinations` per 1,000,000 people in the total population of the state.
* `people_vaccinated`: total number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive the second dose, the metric stays the same.
* `people_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the state.
* `people_fully_vaccinated`: total number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric stays the same. If they receive the second dose, the metric goes up by 1.
* `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_fully_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the state.
* `total_distributed`: cumulative counts of COVID-19 vaccine doses recorded as shipped in CDC's Vaccine Tracking System.
* `total_distributed_per_hundred`: cumulative counts of COVID-19 vaccine doses recorded as shipped in CDC's Vaccine Tracking System per 100 people in the total population of the state.
* `share_doses_used`: share of vaccination doses administered among those recorded as shipped in CDC's Vaccine Tracking System.


## An example of how we calculate our metrics

4 people take part in a vaccination program, to be given a vaccine that requires 2 doses to be effective against the disease.

* Dina has received 2 doses;
* Joel has received 1 dose;
* Tommy has received 1 dose;
* Ellie has not received any dose.

In our data:

* The total number of doses administered (`total_vaccinations`) will be equal to `4` (2 + 1 + 1);
* The total number of people vaccinated (`people_vaccinated`) will be equal to `3` (Dina, Joel, Tommy);
* The total number of people fully vaccinated (`people_fully_vaccinated`) will be equal to `1` (Dina).
