<p class="has-text-align-center">Last update: <strong>April 27, 2021 14:00, London time</strong>.<br><em>(Our testing dataset is updated around twice a week.)</em></p>
<p>We make our full testing dataset, alongside detailed source descriptions, available&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/">on GitHub here</a>. Our testing dataset is updated around twice a week.</p>
<h3>How to cite our testing data</h3>
<p>Hasell, J., Mathieu, E., Beltekian, D. <em>et al.</em> A cross-country database of COVID-19 testing. <em>Sci Data</em> <strong>7</strong>, 345 (2020). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00688-8">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00688-8</a></p>
<h3>About the dataset</h3>
<p>Our goal at <em>Our World in Data</em> is to provide testing data over time for many countries around the world.</p>
<p>To do this, we collect publicly available information published by official sources on a regular basis. Our dataset is updated around twice a week.</p>
<p>Alongside the data, we also aim to provide a good understanding of the definitions used and any important limitations they might have. Our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data">checklist of questions</a> about testing data is what guides our efforts.</p>
<p>We present this information in source descriptions for each country included in the dataset. But in many cases sources do not yet provide the detailed descriptions of the data we would like.</p>
<h3>Which countries do we have testing data for?</h3>
<p>In this map countries for which testing data can be found in our dataset are shown in blue.</p>
<p>As you can see, we do not have data for all countries in our dataset. Those countries where we have looked, but have not been able to find any official sources of testing data are shown in red. Countries which we are either in the process of adding to our dataset, or for which we have not yet been able to look for data are shown in grey.</p>

<h4>How up to date is our data for different countries?</h4>
<p>Countries publish their testing data at different frequencies: some provide daily updates, others only weekly, and some only publish figures on an ad-hoc basis at longer intervals.</p>
<p>Because of this, the most recent data we have for different countries refers to different dates. This chart shows you how up to date the latest data is for each country in our dataset.</p>
<p>Our dataset covers <strong>90%</strong> of the world's population:</p>
<ul><li><strong>44%</strong> is covered with figures relating to <strong>26 April 2021</strong> or later;</li>
<li><strong>64%</strong> is covered with figures relating to <strong>20 April 2021</strong> or later.</li>

<p><strong>Case definition: </strong>PCR + antigen</p>
<p><strong>Positive rate: </strong>calculated by Our World in Data as the 7-day rolling average of daily cases, divided by the 7-day rolling average of daily tests.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Albanian Minsitry of Health and Social Protection publishes daily COVID-19 reports on its <a href="https://shendetesia.gov.al/category/lajme/">website</a> detailing the daily number of tests performed, which we use to construct a time series beginning <a href="https://shendetesia.gov.al/koronavirusi-mshms-asnje-rast-i-konfirmuar-ne-shqiperi/">25 February 2020</a>.<br><br>In some early reports, the testing figures' units are unclear because the same testing figures refer to both the number of cases tested and the number of tests performed; later reports are standardised and testing figures consistently refer to the number of tests performed, so we assume that the discrepancy is due to ambiguous language and translation issues.<br><br>Testing figures refer to PCR and antigen tests. Antigen tests were first reported in Albania on <a href="https://shendetesia.gov.al/covid19-ministria-e-shendetesise-2532-testime-347-te-sheruar-753-raste-te-reja-dhe-14-humbje-jete-ne-24-oret-e-fundit/">8 December 2020</a>. Serological tests are also performed in Albania for "screening purposes" ("p<U+00EB>r arsye depistimi"), meaning that positive results are not used to confirm cases of COVID-19, and so they are excluded from our testing figures to ensure the accuracy of our Positive Rate. In reports from 10 Nov to 6 Dec 2020, testing figures refer to the total number of tests, and specifcy the number of which that are 'for screening purposes'; in such instances, we report the difference between these two figures in order to exclude serological tests. As such, our cumulative total differs that from the total tests ('Testime totale') reported by the source.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Government of Andorra publishes the total number of people tested via PCR and antigen tests since the start of the pandemic. Since both positive PCR and positive antigen tests are counted in the total number of confirmed cases, we also add these two figures to count the number of people tested.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The government of Argentina publishes a complete time series of tests performed on its open data portal: "Information updated daily at 8:00 p.m. notifying COVID-19 tests registered in the country at 17:45."<br><br>The dataset is split by geographical location. We therefore create a daily time series by calculating the total number of tests ("total") for each date ("fecha").<br><br>We calculate a positive rate for Argentina by dividing the 7-day sum of positive tests (column "positivos") by the 7-day sum of tests performed (column "total").<br><br>It is unclear whether the reported figures include pending test results.<br><br>We do not include the last 5 days of data, as the lags in reporting would lead to an underestimated number of tests, and therefore an overestimated positive rate.<br><br>We temporarily stopped publishing data about COVID-19 testing in Argentina between 20 October 2020 and 9 December 2020, due to <a href="https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/testeos-coronavirus-argentina-advierten-negativos-cuentan-dispara-tasa-positividad_0_cwU6GT_cu.html">news reports</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FlorBallarino/status/1317207702892937216">official statements</a> explaining that many negative tests had been found not to be counted in the total number of tests in several provinces. In later communications, advisors to the Minister of Health of Argentina notified us that the issue had been resolved, and our time series for Argentina's testing data were reinstated on 9 December 2020.</p>

More similar additions were made later in January.<br><br>Starting in January 2021, the Austrian government is reporting testing data with a counting methodology that is no longer comparable to the case definition that it uses to report confirmed cases. This leads the positive rate to be substantially underestimated (<1%), regardless of the epidemic situation in the country.<br><br>For these reasons, we are not showing any positive rate for Austria in 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>Sciensano provides a daily time series of the number of tests conducted per day, which is updated retrospectively as new data becomes available each day.<br><br>According to the <a href="https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf">dataset codebook</a>, dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling).<br><br>In its <a href="https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_FAQ_ENG_final.pdf">frequently-asked questions</a>, Sciensano indicates that "the diagnostics include molecular techniques as well as rapid antigen tests. Patients with a positive laboratory result are confirmed cases." We interpret this as follows:<br><U+2014> The number of cases reported for Belgium only includes cases confirmed by a positive PCR test.<br><U+2014> The number of tests reported by Sciensano in its time series of tests performed includes both PCR and antigen tests.<br><br>For this reason, we calculate a positive rate for Belgium by dividing the 7-day sum of positive PCR & antigen tests (column TESTS_ALL_POS) by the 7-day sum of PCR & antigen tests performed (column TESTS_ALL).</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Bolivian Ministry of Health publishes daily COVID-19 briefs on their <a href="https://minsalud.gob.bo/">official website</a> reporting the cumulative number of positive and negative tests, which we sum to determine the cumulative number of tests performed. As such, pending and indeterminate tests are excluded from the testing figures. Data is available from <a href="https://minsalud.gob.bo/3977-corona-informe6">14 March 2020</a>, when 26 tests had been performed.<br><br>A <a href="https://minsalud.gob.bo/guias-para-el-manejo-del-covid-19-ministerio-de-salud">government guide</a> on "Active Community Surveillance Strategy" ("Estrategia de Vigilanica Comunitaria Activa"), published in October, stresses "developing the national network of laboratories for the detection of the virus (RT-PCR method)" ("desarrollando la red nacional de laboratorios para la detecci<U+00F3>n del virus (m<U+00E9>todo RT-PCR)"), and lists all the laboratories in the country with PCR test technology; this document makes no reference to antibody tests. Another <a href="https://www.minsalud.gob.bo/component/jdownloads/download/30-guias-manejo-covid/445-protocolo-para-el-diagnostico-de-laboratorio-en-el-marco-de-la-emergencia-sanitaria-por-covid-actualizado?Itemid=646">document</a> on "Protocol for Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19" ("Protocol para el Diagnostico por Laboratorio de COVID-19"), published in May, indicates that antibody tests are an important aspect of the country's screening and diagnostic process (e.g. see pages 24-27 and annex 2); it also states, however, that "an antibody test will not determine with certainty whether a person currently has COVID-19" ("una prueba de anticuerpos per se no determinar con certeza si actualmente una persona tiene COVID-19"). According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210201015823/https://bo.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">US Embassy in Bolivia</a>, "antigen testing is still unavailable at this time". As such, we conclude that a positive result from a PCR test is necessary to diagnose cases of COVID-19 and that testing figures refer to PCR tests.<br><br>Recent daily briefs consistently report testing figures in terms of the cumulative number of tests ("pruebas") performed. However, in the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily briefs previously reported testing figures using inconsistent terminology such as samples (<U+201C>muestras<U+201D>) tested, people who have undergone tests (<U+201D>personas, que fueron sometidas a pruebas<U+201D>), and tests ("pruebas") performed. It does not appear that this inconsistent use of terminology reflects a substantive change in the reported figures, since there are no corresponding large breaks in the time series.<br><br>In 10 briefs, the number of negative tests was not reported, preventing us from calculating a total for that date. For these dates with missing official data, we use data provided in this <a href="https://github.com/mauforonda/covid19-bolivia">unofficial GitHub repository</a>, which we have cross-referenced against the official data for all dates.<br><br>According to Oxford University's <a href="https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/tree/master/data">Coronavirus Government Response Tracker</a>, government policy currently covers "only those who both (a) have symptoms AND (b) meet specific criteria (eg key workers, admitted to hospital, came into contact with a known case, returned from overseas)"; "the costs of the test are paid in full by the patient".</p>

Since 6 May 2020 they have been reported in terms of "people tested" (e.g. "Dosad je testirano ukupno 41.053 osoba").

The set also includes the number of tests according to the indication (diagnostic indications, epidemiological indications, preventive and comprehensive testing, others), positive results according to the test indication and positive results according to the test type. The source of data is the Central Information System of Infectious Diseases (ISIN). The primary data were analytically processed and subsequently transformed into a form that can be published online by the IHIS CR team."<br><br>We calculate the daily number of tests performed based on the sum of "pocet_PCR_testy" (PCR tests) and "pocet_AG_testy" (antigen tests).<br><br>We also calculate a positive rate by dividing the 7-day sum of positive results ("incidence_pozitivni") by the 7-day sum of tests performed. This positive rate is calculated based on PCR and antigen tests (rather than only PCR) because our source for confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) includes the positive results of antigen tests in the count of daily confirmed cases in Czechia.

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Robert Koch Institute publishes a <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Testzahlen-gesamt.xlsx?__blob=publicationFile">spreadsheet</a> that reports a time series of weekly updates of the cumulative number of PCR tests performed to date, as well as the share of tests that are positive. Where people are tested multiple times, each test will be counted individually. There appear to be reporting lags in the weekly figures, such that the reported figures for any given week increase over the following weeks as labs report additional results. Pending tests are included in the testing figures. The testing figures of up to 204 labs within the country are reported in the dataset. Data is available from the week ending 8 March 2020.<br><br>Our positive rate reflects the official positive rate recorded in column "Positivenquote (%)" of the spreadsheet.<br><br>On 22 October 2020, the Robert Koch Institute published an update of the <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/Ausgaben/43_20.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">National Test Strategy</a>. This update states on page 4 that <U+2018>antigen tests can, under certain conditions, be a useful addition to the PCR test. Antigen tests thus contribute to the further expansion of test capacity<U+2019>. A <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Dez_2020/2020-12-02-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">daily status report</a> from 2 December 2020 notes, 'this can have the consequence that the population of the tested persons differs from that of the previous weeks<U+2019>, as antigen tests are used instead of PCR tests in certain scenarios, which may cause the positive rate to increase. <U+2018>Therefore the positive rates of the previous weeks are not directly comparable with the positive rates from Week 46<U+2019>. According to <a href="https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/Bilder/InfAZ/neuartiges_Coronavirus/Teststrategie.png?__blob=poster&v=8">this infographic</a> from 23 November 2020, positive results from antigen tests must be confirmed with a PCR test, and so they are not included in reported case figures. Antigen tests are also not included in reported testing figures, according to weekly status reports such as on <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Nov_2020/2020-11-25-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">25 Nov 2020</a>.<br><br>For more information about how these details may impact the time series, refer to our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#frequently-asked-questions-about-our-covid-19-testing-dataset">FAQ</a> on our COVID-19 testing dataset.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>Ghana's Outbreak Response Management provides <a href="https://www.ghanahealthservice.org/covid19/archive.php">daily situation updates</a> reporting the total number of samples tested. Data is available from 17 March 2020.<br><br>Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures differ from one another by exactly 981 tests on each day, which is due to persons under mandatory quarantine undergoing multiple test (2,022 samples tested on 1,041 persons). This discrepancy of 981 tests is small, representing less than 1% of cumulative samples tested at the time. In contrast, the cumulative number of samples tested through routine surveillance and contact tracing are exactly equal to the cumulative number of persons tested on each day in these respective categories. <br><br>Prior to 10 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide testing figures using inconsistent terminology, varying between "samples tested", "persons tested", "suspected cases tested", and similar language. Nevertheless, we choose to include all of these figures within our constructed time series, since the variation in terminology does not appear to correspond to large breaks in the time series. In addition, based on the fact that the number of samples tested differs only slightly from the number of persons tested over the 10 May to 26 May 2020 period, we have no reason to believe that the variation in terminology prior to 10 May has any serious ramifications for the interpretation of the time series as the cumulative number of samples tested. From 10 May 2020 onwards, the daily situation updates consistently report the cumulative number of samples tested. <br><br>No further information is provided about the reported testing numbers, such as whether they include pending or non-PCR tests.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Malaysian Ministry of Health provides <a href="http://covid-19.moh.gov.my/terkini">daily situation updates</a> reporting the cumulative number of people tested, which we use to construct a daily time series. The cumulative testing figure, labelled 'Jumlah Individu Disampel', can be found in the infographic titled 'Jumlah Keseluruhan Taburan Kes COVID-19 di Malaysia'.

Both the cumulative and daily totals are available since <a href="https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1320050775872200706">24 Nov 2020</a>; we still determine the cumulative total by summing the daily totals. Note that the sum of daily totals is less that the reported cumulative total, with an average deficit of around 5,500, or about 1%; the cause of this discrepancy is unclear, but appears to be innocuous.<br><br>Prior to 26 June 2020, our source was the daily update videos posted to the Maldives Ministry of Health <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthMV">official Facebook page</a>, which reported the number of positive, pending, and total <U+201C>Laboratory Sample[s]<U+201D> tested toward the end of these videos they report ; before 16 June 2020 the number of negative samples was also reported. The positive, negative, and total numbers are cumulative, while the pending numbers are current as of that day.<br><br>From 16<U+2013>25 June 2020, we used the reported total, which likely includes pending tests. Before 16 June 2020, when negative numbers were reported, we used the total of positive and negative numbers rather than the reported total, since the latter generally included pending values and occasionally contained discrepant numbers that did not match any combination of the positive, negative, or pending numbers. Data is available from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/561317043971945/videos/2617005481743781/">16 March 2020</a>, when 221 samples had been tested.<br><br>According to the <a href="https://covid19.health.gov.mv/updated-case-definitions-for-covid-19/">case definition</a> published 9 Jan 2021, a positive PCR test is necessary to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antigen tests are available but not recommended, and all results should be reported to HPA. It is therefore unclear if antigen tests are included in the number of samples tested; the case definition must match the test definition in order for the Positive Rate to be accurate, and so we exclude our estimate from the dataset.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Mauritania Ministry of Health publishes daily situation reports that state the cumulative number of tests performed to date, as well as the number of tests performed in the past 24 hours.<br><br>According to a <a href="https://fr.ami.mr/Depeche-56446.html">post</a> by the Ministry of Information, antigen tests cannot be used to confirm cases of COVID-19, but are used for screening purposes. Since 7 July 2020, the daily situation reports have differentiated between the number of tests performed in the past 24 hours and the number of "diagnostic" tests performed in the past 24 hours. For example, the <a href="http://www.sante.gov.mr/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/111020-Mauritanie-Sitrep-COVID-19_FR-.pdf">11 October 2020 situation report</a> states: "91 tests performed today including 83 diagnostic tests" (translated). The non-diagnostic tests presumably refer to antigen and antibody screening tests. However, it is unclear if these screening tests are included in the cumulative number of tests performed to date. The case definition therefore may not match the test definition, and so we remove our estimate of the Positive Rate.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>Since July 2020, the Public Health Agency has replaced its previous weekly updates of the number of people tested with the weekly count of tests performed. This data does not allow us to publish any cumulative total, since no data is available on how many tests had been performed prior to the first week of reporting. However, we integrate this data into our "daily tests" time series by dividing each weekly total by 7, thereby estimating the average daily number of tests performed.<br><br>The source notes that "the number of cases reported in the statistics is based on laboratory-confirmed cases", and the number of tests we collect only includes PCR tests.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Federal Office of Public Health presents a time series of daily PCR and antigen tests, downloadable as a CSV file on <a href="https://www.covid19.admin.ch/en/epidemiologic/test">their website</a>.<br><br>We calculate the daily tests performed by filtering for Switzerland (geoRegion == "CH"). We then calculate a positive rate by dividing the 7-day sum of PCR and antigen tests performed (entries) by the 7-day sum of positive PCR and antigen tests (entries_pos).<br><br>The daily number of positive tests does not equal the number number of laboratory-confirmed cases. This is presumably due to the use of multiple tests to confirm one case of COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Ministry of Public Health in Uruguay publishes daily reports providing the cumulative total of tests performed. These figures are also made available on the <a href="https://www.gub.uy/sistema-nacional-emergencias/pagina-embebida/visualizador-casos-coronavirus-covid-19-uruguay">Sistema Nacional de Emergencias dashboard</a>, in which the figures are presented as the number of tests processed since 13 March 2020 ("Desde el 13 de marzo se han procesado: [N] test").<br><br>Antigen tests can be used to confirm cases of COVID-19, according to an <a href="https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-salud-publica/sites/ministerio-salud-publica/files/2021-01/TEST%20DE%20ANTIGENOS%20COVID%2019.pdf">ordinance</a> published by the Ministry of Health on 15 Jan 2021. Antibody tests are not diagnostic, but instead are used for investigative purposes, according to an (article)[https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-salud-publica/comunicacion/noticias/testeos-covid-19-uruguay] posted on 21 Dec 2021.<br><br>We previously reported testing data from a <a href="https://observador.cr/covid19-estadisticas/">dashboard maintained by El Observador</a>, but on 20 April 2020 we replaced the entire time series based on the reports from the Ministry of Health.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Vietnam General Department of Preventive Medicine provided daily COVID-19 bulletins that periodically report the cumulative number of samples tested to date. The bulletins extend back to 13 February 2020 and ceased on 15 October 2021. The Ministry of Health now sporadically shares testing data on their <a href="https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/">website</a>. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that 856 samples had been tested as of 13 February 2020.<br><br>We have been unable to find testing figures in any of the bulletins published between 29 April 2020 and 28 July 2020, with the exception of a 4 July 2020 bulletin reporting that 379,701 samples had been tested to date. From 29 July 2020 onwards, the bulletins make it clear that the testing figures relate to PCR tests only.<br><br>Some bulletins report the cumulative number of people tested alongside the cumulative number of samples tested. Oddly, the cumulative number of people tested is larger than the cumulative number of samples tested. For example, <a href="http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/phong-chong-dich-benh-viem-phoi-cap-ncov/14061/ban-tin-cap-nhat-dich-benh-covid-19-ngay-18-9-2020">the 18 September 2020 bulletin</a> reports 1,183,341 samples tested to date using PCR, while at the same time reporting 1,358,575 people tested to date. Further, a 15 March 2021 <a href="https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/-/6847912-112">press statement</a> reports 2,482,302 RT-PCR tests as well as 3,248,873 people tested. The article also states that "the number of rooms capable of testing for ... SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR technique is 157 rooms, the maximum testing capacity is about 62,593 samples / day", while "the number of rooms that have been allowed for confirmed testing is 101 rooms with a maximum testing capacity of about 50,663 samples per day." In another <a href="https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/-/6847912-109">article</a>, it is stated that "in case of suspected positive, positive must immediately transfer the sample to the laboratory that has been allowed to test confirm SARS-CoV-2". As such, one explanation for this discrepancy is that samples are tested multiple times.<br><br>Bulletins published between 13 February 2020 and 28 April 2020 report the cumulative number of samples tested to date alongside the cumulative number of samples with positive test results and the cumulative number of samples with negative test results, which suggests that in this time period the total number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it is unclear whether samples with negative test results include instances of resampling for the same person.</p>

<p><strong>Positive rate: </strong>calculated by Our World in Data as the 7-day rolling average of daily cases, divided by the 7-day rolling average of daily tests.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Zambia Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Zambia Statistics Agency, provides a time series of the number of samples tested each day since 19 March 2020 in an <a href="https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19">official dashboard</a>.<br><br>The dashboard data is sourced from daily reports produced by the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.zm/">Ministry of Health</a> (published on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mohzambia">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mohzambia">Twitter</a> pages) and the <a href="https://znphi.co.zm/news/situation-reports-new-coronavirus-covid-19-sitreps">Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)</a>. <br><br>To ensure accuracy, we have cross-checked a sample of the dashboard figures against the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI reports.<br><br>Official reports from the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI use the terminology "tests conducted" and "samples tested" interchangeably over time, with no indication that the choice of terminology represents a substantive difference in the reported figures.<br><br>The reported figures that are based on ZNPHI reports exclude pending test results, while it is unclear whether the reported figures from the Ministry of Health reports exclude pending test results. Nevertheless, pending test results represent a small fraction of overall tests, so this possible discrepancy is of minor consequence.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br>The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care provides daily press releases on its website and Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim">@MoHCCZim</a>) that report the cumulative number of tests performed to date. The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results.<br><br>The press release for 6 May 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 "rapid screening" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.<br><br>Prior to 6 May 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on 6 May 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests.<br><br>Since <a href="https://twitter.com/MoHCCZim/status/1351632194033360903/photo/1">19 Jan 2021</a>, the press releases report a combined cumualtive total of PCR and rapid antigen tests. According to a <a href="https://zimbabwe.un.org/en/111012-capacitating-rural-health-facilities-rapid-covid-19-testing">United Nations report</a>, published on 27 January 2021, antigen tests can be used to diagnose cases of COVID-19.</p>
