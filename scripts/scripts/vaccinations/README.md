# Vaccination update automation

Vaccination data is updated on a daily basis. For some countries, the update is done by means of an automated process,
while others require some manual work. To keep track of the currently automated processes, check [this
table](automation_state.csv), and [`batch`](src/vax/batch) and [`incremental`](src/vax/incremental) folders for
automated scripts.

- [`vaccinations.csv`](../../../public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv): main output with vaccination data of all countries.
- [`vaccinations.json`](../../../public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.json): same as `vaccinations.csv` but in JSON format.
- [`country_data`](../../../public/data/vaccinations/country_data/): individual country CSV files.
- [`locations.csv`](../../../public/data/vaccinations/locations.csv): country-level metadata.
- [`vaccinations-by-manufacturer.csv`](../../../public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations-by-manufacturer.csv): secondary output with vaccination by manufacturer for a select number of countries.

- [`COVID-19 - Vaccinations by manufacturer.csv`](../../grapher/COVID-19%20-%20Vaccinations%20by%20manufacturer.csv): internal file for OWID grapher on vaccinations by manufacturer.

_You can find more information about these files [here](../../../public/data/vaccinations/README.md)_.


## Update the data

To update the data, make sure you follow the steps below.


### 0. Dependencies


#### 0.1 Python and R
Make sure you have a working environment with R and python 3 installed. We recommend R >= 4.0.2 and Python >= 3.7.

You can check:

```
$ python --version
```
and
```
$ R --version
```

#### 0.2 Install python requirements
In your environment (shell), run:

```
$ pip install -e .
```

#### 0.3 Install R requirements
In your R console, run:

```r
install.packages(c("data.table", "imputeTS", "lubridate", "readr", "retry", "rjson", "stringr", "tidyr", "jsonlite", "bit64"))
```

#### 0.4 Configuration file (internal)

Create a file `vax_dataset_config.json` with all required parameters:

```json
{
    "greece_api_token": "[GREECE_API_TOKEN]",
    "owid_cloud_table_post": "[OWID_CLOUD_TABLE_POST]",
    "google_credentials": "[CREDENTIALS_JSON_PATH]",
    "google_spreadsheet_vax_id": "[SHEET_ID]"
}
```

For `google`-related fields, you'll need a valid OAuth JSON credentials file, as explained in the [gsheets documentation](https://gsheets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#quickstart).


### 1. Manual data updates

Check for new updates and manually add them in the internal spreadsheet:
- See this repo's [pull requests](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues).
- Look for new data based on previously-used source URLs.


### 2. Automated process
Run the following script:

```
$ python src/vax/
```

By default it will do the following:
1. Run the scrips for [batch](src/vax/batch) and [incremental](src/vax/incremental) updates. It will then generate
  individual country files and save them in [`output`](output).
2. Collect manually updated data from the spreadsheet and data generated in (1). Process this data, and generate public country data in
  [`country_data`](../../../public/data/vaccinations/country_data/), as well as temporary files 
  `vaccinations.preliminary.csv` and `metadata.preliminary.csv` which are later
  required by `generate_dataset.R`.

**Note 1**: this step might crash for some countries, as the automation scripts might no longer (or temporarily) work
(e.g. due to changes in the source). Try to keep the scripts up to date.

**Note 2**: Optionally you can use arguments `--no-get-data` and `--no-process-data` to skip steps 1 or 2, respectively.
E.g. executing `$ python src/vax --no-get-data` will just run step 2. For more info check `$ python src/vax --help`.

**Note 3**: Use option `--parallel` to run the code using parallelisation.

### 3. Dataset generation
Make sure you've succesfully [configured your environment](#0.-dependencies), then run the following script:

```
$ Rscript generate_dataset.R
```

Running this script in an interactive environment (typically RStudio) is recommended, as it'll make the
potential debugging process much easier.


### 4. Megafile generation

This will update the complete COVID dataset, which also includes all vaccination metrics:

```
$ python ../megafile.py
```

**Note**: you can use [vax_update.sh.template](vax_update.sh.template) as an example of how to automate data updates and push them to the repo.


## Other functions
### Check the style
We use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to check the style of our code. The configuration lives in file 
[tox.ini](tox.ini). To check the style, simply run

```sh
$ tox
```
**Note**: This requires tox to be installed (`$ pip install tox`)

### Tracking
It is extremely usefull to get some insights on which data are we tracking (and which are we not). This can be done with
module [`vax.tracking`](src/vax/tracking). Find below some use cases.

**Note**: Use uption `--to-csv` to export results as csv files (a default filename is used).

#### Which countries are missing?
Run 

```
$ python src/vax/tracking --countries-missing
```
Countries are given from most to least populated.

#### Which countries haven't been updated for some time?
Get the list of countries and their last update by running:

```
$ python src/vax/tracking --countries-last-updated
```

Countries are given from least to most recently updated.
#### Which countries are missing?
Get the list of countries least updated:

```
$ python src/vax/tracking --countries-least-updated
```

Countries are given from least to most frequently updated.

#### Which vaccines are missing?
Get the list of countries with missing vaccines:

```
$ python src/vax/tracking --vaccines-missing
```

Countries are given from the one with the least to the one with he most number of untracked vaccines.


## FAQs
### CONTRIBUTE: How to add new automated data collections
- Create a script and place it in [`src/vax/batch`](src/vax/batch) or
[`src/vax/incremental`](src/vax/incremental) depending, on whether it is an incremental or batch update (see [#250](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/250)
for more details).
- Test that it is working and stable.
- Issue a pull request and wait for a review.

### CONTRIBUTE: How to report new data
If you want to report new data points, please note the following:
- For automated countries (see [here](automation_state.csv)) new data might appear in next update
- For manual imported country data, please open an issue or a PR specifying the source of your data. Note: Open one
  issue/PR per country!

More details: [#230](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/230), [#250](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/250)
### If an automation no longer works
If you detect that an automation is no longer working, and the process seems like it can't be fixed at the moment:
- Set its state to `automated = FALSE` in the `LOCATIONS` tab of the internal spreadsheet.
- Add a new tab in the spreadsheet to manually input the country data. Make sure to include the historical data from the [`output`](output) file.
- Delete the automation script and automated CSV output to avoid confusion.
